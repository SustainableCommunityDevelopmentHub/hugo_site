    "description": "Municipal Solid Waste Disposal Decision Portal Today, the disposal of wastes by land filling or land spreading is the ultimate fate of all solid wastes, whether they are residential wastes collected and transported directly to a landfill site, residual materials from materials recovery facilities (MRFs), residue from the combustion of solid waste, compost, or other substances from various solid waste processing facilities. A modern sanitary landfill is not a dump; it is an engineered facility used for disposing of solid wastes on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety, such as the problems of insects and the contamination of ground water.",

Vision journalist Kari Costanza walks a mile in Sabina&rsquo;s shoes in rural Africa, experiencing her daily journey to retrieve clean water. ________________________________\nSubscribe to World Vision USA: http://bit.ly/1VOtih9\nSponsor a child today: http://bit.ly/1Mn85cv\nCharacter count: 7074 ' Duration in seconds:807 ' Characters per second: 8.77 this is the story of Sabina Sabina is much like me we are both mothers who work hard taking care of our families but there's one big difference between Sabina and me since the age of seven Sabina has gone to the river nearly every day to fetch water I stayed with Sabina for 24 hours to watch how she used her time and how she used water I watched as her day began at sunrise and throughout the day as she cared for her husband Jacob a farmer who raised his livestock I watched as she mothered her children including her new baby I saw how water was part of every aspect of Sabinas day and how if she wasn't using water she was walking to get it when that David AVI a four mile round-trip walk to a dirty river where she scoops water from a hole twice a day with her best friend Christina and I realized I couldn't truly understand what it was like to walk and Sabina shoes unless I did it myself no it's light right now maybe later it was very heavy this fence is just one of the many obstacles that the women face as they're going to the river that's the other obstacles our forms are everywhere they're above us they're below us step on thorns my hair gets caught in thorns and the water itself is an obstacle it's an obstacle to a girl's future because they have to get water all the time they're not getting education they're going to the river look there's what there's a container there okay it looks like somebody got water from here yeah geez that thing is full water is not just scarce here it's really really yucky people come to the water source we're right next to just because it's so much easier to get water from here than to go all the way to the river but this kind of water is just a breeding ground for typhoid and cholera and waterborne diseases that cause diarrhea in fact just last night Sabina and Jacob had to take the baby to the health clinic Jude fever and then she vomited and had diarrhea every 10 minutes she had to have an IV for 24 hours okay I got it neither rock in my shoe the closer the closer I get to the river the more nervous I get because I don't know if I'm gonna be able to carry this water this could be extremely embarrassing okay and there's well oh my goodness we just got the go-ahead to the river Mary ran ahead to warn the women who are bathing there here goes nothing it's ten after three we left at ten after two it's taken us an hour to get here the water is today a bit browner than the other day we were here so we need to scoop another hole to get water kay you show me and I'll do it okay it looks pretty Brown make the hole bigger with our hands okay so now we're just getting this dirty water out of the hole that we dug oopsie we had a little landfill that incident here sorry that was my father when I was in a spelling bee I lost on the word arduous I'm still not sure how to spell it but now I know what it means I know this water is not good it looks okay but it's not okay the little health clinic we went to today average is ten kids a day and this water is a big part of the reason they go so we brought a scale along so we can weigh these it's so happy can you read the scale 57 for the big 157 pounds and the little one oh it's so light 15 pounds for the little one so 57 plus 13 is 70 pounds yeah so now for the hard part Christina and Sabina are going home to me to put this on my back and carry it the two miles home but it was awful and the worst part of it is I have a huge audience watching me okay this is I gotta say a little prayer first okay this to the side thank to the knees beneath then up okay I can't really get to the need this is too heavy to really get to the knees oh okay come on knees yeah okay then the up part so I get up now oh I feel like a Russian weightlifter mm-hmm all right then what do we do we put that one on here hey that came in more than a lakh yeah oh yeah yep that's 70 pounds its 355 and I've just started and I'm already tired the straps are digging into my shoulders I think this would be the longest hour of my life I'll just stand here for just a second just a second I'll just rest for one second I know we're not to the resting place yet I can do this I can do this we can do this I can't go to the dentist but I can do this okay let's go oh one thing the lady said to me is they hate how they get back aches when they do this they say the pain just builds and builds as they go and go and it takes a while for their back to stop aching when they get home I can feel it I can feel my back aching oops except we just started thank you so much Christina got me some kindling to use as a walking stick which is nice feel like Moses now with the Red Sea on my back Sabina makes this trip twice a day she uses about 13 gallons a day that's for everything cooking cleaning drinking bathing and so in this trip I'm carrying half of the water she was today one of the most poignant stories Sabina told me was how she had seen running water once in her life was three years ago it was in place called laylan which has water it has Springs and people have water right in their yards and she went from house to house to see this incredible sight this water that came right from a tap that she didn't have to get from the river and she said I never knew that there were places that weren't like this and once I was there I didn't want to come back I'm Sabina about her dreams her children it would be well yet even on and her dream is that they would all get an education the education she never got because she had to fetch water and then I asked her what her dream for herself is and she said I just like to be able to take a bath at my house know the game I have to go across the gate because there's storm brushes on either side and as I'm going across the gate I'm remembering House of Mina went across this gate every day she was pregnant including the day she gave birth if she can do it nine months pregnant I can do it at forty seven maybe Robin no no what I can do this oh ouch hey oh yeah I can get up there right there oh my foot doesn't really move like that when you done okay then then what do I do okay that this leg has to oh yeah okay then what getting down I've always thought about water in terms of disease how if you don't have water or if you have bad water you get sick and you can die but I have a new understanding of water now it's not just about disease if you don't have water it robbed you of time it robs you of education Sabina didn't get to go to school and now because she has to go for hours every day to get this water she doesn't have the time that she wants to spend with her family and do the things that she actually wants to do like plant a kitchen garden and that doesn't seem too much to ask to me so my wish for Sabina today is that water will come close to her so she won't be chained to that river anymore and she'll get back the time that she deserves and needs to have a full life would you like some water Gary Ghana dog Regan and Fanning Ali Ali no gimme gana Sabha yog okay League an answer on okay Regan and polygon on   ",

Dilution of sewage decreases the efficiency of treatment, and may cause sewage volumes to exceed design capacity. Although inflow is technically different from infiltration, it may be difficult to determine which is causing dilution problems in inaccessible sewers.

leaves the house through the main drain pipe meets up with the sewer right down here in some places to combine sewer both wastewater and storm water in other words everything from inside your house and everything from outside your house brain whatever goes into a single combined sewer offices shops factories and other industries together with rain water that runs off roofs and roads sewage is washed flushed or drained into sewers the underground network of sewers that collect all this wastewater and transports it to the sewage works is known as the sewerage system in the area it drains is the catchment area all of it heads towards the wastewater treatment plant in some places the sewers are separated one for wastewater and the other for storm water in that case only the wastewater heads towards the wastewater treatment plant the storm sewer goes straight to the river untreated because it&rsquo;s only water right actually no it isn&rsquo;t all the chemicals that you put on your lawn or the soap with all the phosphates that you wash your car with all head out the storm sewer if you&rsquo;ve got a separated system straight into the room all the wastewater fins up at moist water treatment plants originally established by the Royal Commission on sewage disposal 1898 1915 objectives of sewerage treatment had as follows to avoid pestilence and nuisance disease and odor the protection of potable water sources from pollution by sewerage discharge and to produce effluence which after dilution with with water a suitable for abstraction as sources of potable supply sewage is a complex mixture of suspended and dissolved materials both categories constitute organic pollution the strength of sewage and the quality of sewage effluent are described in terms of their suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand these two measures were originally either proposal devised by the Royal Commission the suspended solids are determined by way after the filtration of a known volume of sample through a standard glass fiber filter paper the results being expressed in milligrams per liter dissolved pollutants are determined by the biochemical oxygen demand they exert when incubated for five days at twenty degrees Celsius samples require appropriate dilution with oxygen saturated water and suitable replication the oxygen consumed is determined and the results are get expressed in milligrams per litre the two standards for sewage effluent quality proposed by the Royal Commission or for no more than 30 milligrams per liter of suspended solids and 20 milligrams per litre for biochemical oxygen demand the so-called 30 to 20 standard the Royal Commission in visits that the effluent of this standard would be diluted 8 to 1 with clean river water having biochemical oxygen demand of 2 milligrams per litre or less this standard was considered to be the normal minimum requirement and was not enforced by statute because the character and use of rivers varied so greatly currently most sewage treatment works are required to meet discharge standards set by the urban waste water treatment directive the flow of sanitary sewage alone in the absence of storms in dry season is known as dry weather flow DWF the purpose of these plans is to remove all solids and pathogens you know microorganisms like bacteria and stuff from the wastewater so when it gets reintroduced to the river it&rsquo;s cleaner than when it arrived at the wastewater treatment plant when it arrives coarse screens remove large solids rags and debris from wastewater and are immediately disposed of it&rsquo;s here that you see some of the most ridiculous things people have put down their toilets drains and sewers at least this stuff made it this far some things that the water can&rsquo;t dissolve end up stuck in the sewers leading to sewers being clogged and homes being flooded after those fine screens are used to remove the smaller material in the same way next up is grit removal grit includes sand gravel and other heavy solid materials that are heavier than the organic solids in the wastewater removal of grit happens by getting the wastewater to flow in a spiral pattern heavier particles settle at the bottom of the tank while lighter organic particles are suspended and eventually carried out of the tank from there that water is sent into a settling basin this is where suspended solids settle out and floating scum is removed by skimmers scrapers in the tank moved continuously along the bottom to deposit the raw sludge into hoppers which is sent to a nearby plant where it&rsquo;s made into pellets for fertilizer after the settling basins the wastewater is sent to the next step by a Archimedes screw pump which forces the liquid upwards the revolutions raise the water thread by thread until it comes out at the top of the cylinder there it is met by the fine curve screen where small items that have made it through the initial screening process are removed things like fruit and vegetable stickers they don&rsquo;t dissolve and they clog up the system so when you&rsquo;re pilling them off throw them in the garbage not down the sink now it&rsquo;s time to get the stuff you can&rsquo;t see some of this work is done by biological aerated filters essentially what happens here is that good microorganisms attached to porous rock eat up the bad microorganisms the waste water is pumped up through the rocks and the bacteria in the water sticks to the rocks bubbles are pumped in to keep the good bacteria alive and working the clean water goes up in the rocks with the bad bacteria attached to them go back down this cleansed water then flows into a channel on its way to be treated by ultraviolet light the water passes high output UV lamps where light disrupts the molecular structure of DNA molecules and the micro organisms this renders the cells unable to replicate before they die the disinfection stage takes seconds eliminates the need for chlorine and makes the final process much safer let&rsquo;s look now at the sewage treatment process a sewage works such as this treats nearly 40,000 cubic meters of mainly domestic sewage each day at this site trade waste from two local food manufacturers comprises about 8% of the total flow rainwater runoff referred to a surface flow is also treated for simplicity we will refer to all the incoming waste waters as sewage that the sewage treatment works the incoming waste passes through screens which remove large pieces of debris such as plastic paper and cloth the liquid then flows through a number of channels which take out any grit washed in from roads the raw sewage entering the works passes through six millimeter mesh screens the collected solid matter is called screenings and typically comprises rags cotton buds sanitary products and paper the screenings are compacted and sent to landfill the sewage then flows to a grit extractor of the cross-flow type we Road grit and other inorganic matter settle out this material is subsequently washed and also sent to landfill the sewage is then passed forward to large tanks here fine particles sink to the bottom and form a sludge which is regularly removed and further treated on leaving the grit extractor the sewage enters the primary settlement tanks here approximately 70% of the remaining solid matter settles out and forms primary sludge which collects in a sump at the bottom of the tank periodically the sludge is pumped away for disposal or for treatment above this sludge lies the waste water it now has a greatly reduced amount of suspended solids and with it about 30% less biochemical oxygen demand or VOD for short here we use bacteria to clean up the liquid sewage the bacteria help purify the liquid by actively feeding on it and turning most of it into carbon dioxide water and nitrogen in biological filters we encourage bacteria to grow in deep beds of irregularly shaped stones gaps between the stones circulate air which lets the bacteria breathe and thrive that the liquid passes through them an alternative to biological filters is a process called activated sludge where air is bubbled through the sewage to encourage bacteriological growth the air can then be pumped or entrained from the surface by rotating paddles either way once the bacteria have done their work the liquid goes into further settling tanks to remove the remaining particles leaving clean water to flow to the river or if necessary onward to further treatment on this site the wastewater is treated in one of three different types of biological system namely biological filters activated sludge units or oxygen ditches first there were only the biological filters but over the years the activated sludge unit and oxygen ditches were installed here you can see the rectangular biological filters in many works they&rsquo;re circular but irrespective of their shape biological filters are robust and easy to operate microorganisms growing on the clinker in the bed break down the organic matter in the effluent on leaving the filters the effluent is dosed with ferric sulfate in order to precipitate out the phosphates this prevents eutrophication occurring in the river when the treated effluent is finally discharged at the end of the process the effluent then goes to a humours tank for secondary settlement where microbial solids and precipitated phosphates settle out and are removed a sludge you can see that the water looks much cleaner than it was at the inlet an alternative to the biological filter is the activated sludge unit here the wastewater is aerated and mixed by fine bubbles of air blown through hundreds of ceramic or plastic diffusers such as this the organic matter in the sewage is again broken down by microorganisms but this time they&rsquo;re suspended in the mixed liquor in a tank the remaining system is the oxygen ditch where almost one-fifth of the sewage at this plant is treated interestingly the oxygen ditch doesn&rsquo;t require primary settlement the sewage is aerated with the help of large brush raters and the effluent moves around the ditch allowing the organic matter to be degraded by microbes in suspension on exiting it goes to a settlement tank and then to the gravel filter treated effluent from all three systems comes together before discharge into the nearby river you simplistic terms nitrogen in various forms is flushed rinsed or otherwise introduced into the sewer system almost all of this organic nitrogen urea for example is immediately hydrolyzed into ammonia in water gaseous ammonia nh3 is almost entirely converted to ionized ammonia or ammonium nh4 plus specialized autotrophic bacteria or nitrifiers convert the ammonium to nitrite no.",

Simon in 1956,[3] although the concept was first posited in his 1947 book Administrative Behavior.[4][5] Simon used satisficing to explain the behavior of decision makers under circumstances in which an optimal solution cannot be determined.",

Johann Hari&rsquo;s important work helps us understand addiction as a symptom of social isolation. If as he states, &ldquo;the opposite of addiction is not sobriety, the opposite of addiction is connection&rdquo;, then sustainable community development is the only way to really address the modern crisis of opiate, alcohol and sugar addiction in modern society.",

In many countries in the Middle East and North African region,untreated greywater is used for irrigation purposes due to the environmentally andpolitically determined water scarcity of the region, and is stored in privately constructed holding tanks. Along with risks to human health in the holding and reuse of this water forirrigation, the hiring of private parties to regularly empty these tanks is a cost burden onhouseholds, as public infrastructure is not always available to do so, especially in rural areas.",
