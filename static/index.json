Starting with cow dung, Jose has created an ingenious system that simultaneously captures and separates nitrogen-rich organic manure and methane gas. Unlike dried cow dung, which tends to lose nitrogen throughout the drying process, the liquefied organic manure produced through Joses slurry provides soil with far higher levels of nitrogen. Additionally, the methane gas removed is used as a form of fuel. Jose estimates that the dung from two cows is sufficient to provide enough biogas to support the cooking requirements of a family of four. Resourceful, intelligent, simple great stuff!\nThanks to www.organicguide.com for this summary!\nsee also \nPart I 'Organic Farming'\nPart III 'Organic pesticide and fungicide",

The thought was to enlarge this system and test it with a prototype. Through parametric modeling in Rhino and grasshopper a form was developed. Then in a form of design + build the prototype was constructed. \n\nThe following people deserve thanks for helping to make this semester possible.Without their help this would have not been possible.

Most families in China still cook using stoves that burn coal or wood which has led to severe deforestation and dangerous levels of indoor air pollution, particularly from coal use. Crop waste is widely available in China yet very few stove designs have been able to burn this waste effectively. The Daxu stove is not only designed to burn crop waste, either loose or in briquettes, it is also 40% efficient, produces hardly any smoke, cuts cooking and heating costs by 50% and, if it replaces a traditional coal burning stove, it can saves around eight tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. With its two hot plates, it also allows families to cook a stir-fry dish and steamed rice at the same time. Some Daxu stove models also come with a back boiler which provides hot running water and heating to rural families, often for the first time. It is hardly surprising that since September last year, 25,000 models have been sold, with 10,000 sold in the first three months of 2007. There is enormous potential for introducing this technology throughout China, since over 20 million wood and coal stoves are sold each year.\nCategory\nNonprofits & Activism",

There are over 25,000 of these mills in Nepal that use the power of running water to grind grain into flour. Unfortunately, they can no longer produce enough energy to meet local demand, resulting in a rise in the number of diesel-powered mills. The water mills are also extremely hard work to operate and millers often work 12 hours a day in order to make a living. Since 2003, CRT/Nepal has intensified work to upgrade the water mills making them more efficient and capable of providing other services such as electricity generation and paddy hulling. To date, over 2,400 water mills have been upgraded increasing the grinding capacity by more than 100% cutting down the waiting time for women users, significantly increasing millers income and stemming the rise in diesel mills. It is estimated that each improved mill can offset diesel, equivalent to 2.4 tonnes/year CO2.\nCategory\nNonprofits & Activism\nLicense\nStandard YouTube License",

It is difficult to comprehend the scale. It is difficult too to comprehend the scale of humanity and the vast changes we've wrought in a lifetime. \n\nPopulation, production and consumption have grown exponentially. Roads, railways, airlines, shipping routes. The digital revolution. We've created a globally interconnected society. Evidence is mounting we've entered the Anthropocene.\n\nHumanity is altering Earth's life support system. Carbon dioxide emissions are accelerating. Greenhouse gas levels are unprecedented in human history. The climate system is changing rapidly.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assesses the risks and options for societies. \n\nIts latest report states it is extremely likely humans are the dominant cause of warming in the past 60 years.\n\nWithout deep emissions cuts, it is likely Earth will cross the target of two degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The target set by international policy. This could happen as early as 2050. \n\nIf emissions keep rising at current rates, a four-degree rise by 2100 is as likely as not. This marks a vast transformation of our planet.\n\nIt is very likely heatwaves will occur more often and last longer.\n\nThe Arctic will warm faster than the global average. It is likely sea ice will all but vanish in summer within decades if high emissions continue. It is very likely sea-level rise will accelerate. Cities and coastal areas are vulnerable. \n\nIn general, wet regions are set to get wetter, dry regions drier. Monsoons are likely to become longer, their footprint likely to grow and downpours likely to intensify. \n\nThe acidity of the ocean has increased 26% since the start of the industrial revolution. \n\nThe full consequences of all these changes on the Earth system are unknown.\n\nHumanity's carbon footprint is huge. Societies will need to adapt to climate change. The scale of change depends on decisions made now. \n\nCan we remain below two degrees? It is possible. But it is up to societies now to decide the future we want. For a likely chance of achieving the two-degree target, societies can emit another 250 billion tonnes of carbon. \n\nWe burn about 10 billion tonnes of carbon a year.\n\nAt current rates we will use this budget in about 25 years.",

Most families in China still cook using stoves that burn coal or wood which has led to severe deforestation and dangerous levels of indoor air pollution, particularly from coal use. Crop waste is widely available in China yet very few stove designs have been able to burn this waste effectively. The Daxu stove is not only designed to burn crop waste, either loose or in briquettes, it is also 40% efficient, produces hardly any smoke, cuts cooking and heating costs by 50% and, if it replaces a traditional coal burning stove, it can saves around eight tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. With its two hot plates, it also allows families to cook a stir-fry dish and steamed rice at the same time. Some Daxu stove models also come with a back boiler which provides hot running water and heating to rural families, often for the first time. It is hardly surprising that since September last year, 25,000 models have been sold, with 10,000 sold in the first three months of 2007. There is enormous potential for introducing this technology throughout China, since over 20 million wood and coal stoves are sold each year.\nCategory\nNonprofits & Activism",

Deng has done this by venturing out of the capital and setting up a network of dealers to service the more remote areas. Deng has also set up a training centre for solar technicians in order to further expand the business and ensure the future sustainability of the scheme. The training centre, which has already trained 120 people from various sectors, is in itself a significant driver for growth of the solar PV market in Ghana. Whilst Deng does sell and install PV-powered grid backup systems around Accra, the mission and focus of Deng is in providing solar electricity to rural areas that do not have grid access. Since 1998 Deng has supplied 1,000 fixed systems and 6,000 solar lanterns to communities across Ghana.\nCategory\nNonprofits & Activism",

In many countries in the Middle East and North African region,untreated greywater is used for irrigation purposes due to the environmentally andpolitically determined water scarcity of the region, and is stored in privately constructed holding tanks. Along with risks to human health in the holding and reuse of this water forirrigation, the hiring of private parties to regularly empty these tanks is a cost burden onhouseholds, as public infrastructure is not always available to do so, especially in rural areas. The safe treatment of this water can provide an alternative to other costly andsources of irrigation.

How do we approach the transformation to student-centric learning using what learning science tells us to do, and not do, to enhance student success?\n\nIn their new book, \"Breakthrough Leadership in the Digital Age\", Hess and Saxberg offer that there's never been a better time to be a \"learning engineer\" -- working to apply what's known about learning to the very real challenges of developing affordable, reliable, available, data-rich competency-based learning environments.\n\nOur educational leaders must take up the challenge to become empowered with \"cage-busting leadership\" in order to take on the laws, rules, and regulations that prevent them from implementing true transformational changes to our educational systems. Citing many examples of leaders who have busted out of the cage, Hess will illustrate how tough decisions can be made to provide the quality education we seek for our students.\n\nThe crux of how to break down barriers, enable good teachers to do great work and provide students from all backgrounds equity and excellent opportunities to learn and thrive is at the heart of this discussion. Their book provides a framework, common language, and real-world examples of how to do just that.\n\nSaxberg is a researcher and visionary on digital learning's ability to transform education. This keynote will both connect the dots between research on the best learning environments for how student learn and identify breakthrough tactics to overcome what stands in the way of the revolution toward student-centered learning.\n\nBy design and through science, it is evident that digital learning offers solutions for transforming education around student-centered and highly personalized learning. Combining a solution-driven approach with strong \"cage-busting\" leadership will offer tremendous insights and tools for leaders committed to doing what is right for kids.\nCategory\nEducation",

Lack of access to electricity for these remote communities has restricted the economic development of the area with many people leaving in search of better opportunities. Since the arrival of micro-hydro the area is thriving as those who had left are returning, bringing their businesses with them, and others are also migrating to the area. Some villages have even doubled in size and for over 60% of villagers, their incomes have increased as a direct result of the micro-hydro power. Crucial to the success of the project is the involvement of the community. The villagers themselves contribute towards installation costs and are responsible for the day-to-day running of the plants. More and more villages are approaching Practical Action for installations and, so far, only a tiny fraction of the micro-hydro potential in the Eastern Andes has been exploited.\n",

CREATE! works with rural communities to reverse this trend, clearing unused land and restoring it to productivity. Working in cooperative groups, our beneficiaries receive comprehensive training in year-round sustainable crop cultivation and use their own labor and simple tools to clear, fence, plant, water, tend and harvest cooperative community vegetable gardens that yield a bountiful harvest and provide a much needed source of income, all without the use of fossil fuels.\n\nEnergy and Environment\nConserving energy and protecting the environment are major challenges throughout sub-Saharan Africa. This is especially true in rural areas, where most cooking is done over open fires and electricity is usually generated using non-renewable, unsustainable and costly diesel fuel. CREATE! is addressing these problems in Senegal by teaching community members to construct and use fuel-efficient cookstoves made from free, local materials; establishing tree nurseries in cooperative community gardens that provide thousands of seedlings for food production, living fences and local reforestation; and installing solar pumping systems to pump water from hand-dug wells.\nCategory\nNonprofits & Activism",

Shidhulai has achieved this by building up a fleet of flat-bottomed boats, all made with locally available materials, that make their way through the shallow rivers and canals of the Chalanbeel to bring a range of educational services and renewable energy supplies to water-side families. The boats use solar PV modules to generate all the electricity they need to provide daily classes in primary education for children, libraries, training in sustainable agriculture, health advice, mobile phone and internet access and battery-charging facilities. Shidhulai has also provided villagers with 13,500 solar-home-systems, 2,500 lanterns and 15,000 bicycle pumps that deliver between 60 and 100 litres of water per minute - enough to irrigate half a hectare of land during the dry season. By putting into practice the agricultural techniques they have learnt on the boats and using the renewable energy devices, farmers have been able to significantly increase their income and reduce the use of synthetic pesticides, with about one third of farmers eliminating their use altogether.\nCategory\nNonprofits & Activism",

The benefits of biogas are well known. It provides rural women with a cheap, reliable source of energy as well as reducing indoor air pollution and easing pressure on forest resources. Less well known is how turning the biogas residue into high quality fertiliser can increase crop yields and, more importantly, give rural women the chance to make a profit. The units supplied by SKG Sangha produce fertiliser simply by combining the slurry with straw and leaves and then adding worms which re-digest the mixture to produce vermicompost. This vermicompost improves the yields of family crops and the liquid output from the unit can be used as an organic pesticide. The growing demand in India for organic fertiliser means that women can earn as much from selling half the vermicompost they produce as the household earns from selling the crops they grow. Since 1993, SKG Sangha has installed over 43,000 biogas plants in the state of Karnataka alone.\r\nCategory\r\nNonprofits & Activism",

This commercial approach works because Sunlabob uses high-quality components to ensure reliability and places a strong emphasis on customer support and training local entrepreneurs to maintain the systems. To date 1,870 solar systems, including 20 larger ones for community use, and 500 solar lanterns are rented to families in 73 villages providing electricity for lighting, entertainment and other uses such as refrigeration for vaccines. The potential for growth is huge; Sunlabob is already installing systems at a rate of 500 a year, and new investment this year will allow it to scale up to 2,500 systems, and 5,000 after that.",

Invented in South Africa in the early 1990s, the PlayPump system is a children's roundabout that drives a borehole pump, which pumps water to an elevated water tank. The tank bears billboards, whose rental is intended to fund the maintenance of the pump. The project received much international support as an 'appropriate technology' for developing world use, winning awards and attracting large-scale funding, culminating in 2006 in a collective pledge of US$60 million from government and private institutions in the United States. But soon afterwards a series of critical reports on the PlayPump surfaced, casting into doubt the claims for its success... The Problem with the PlayPump documents the difference between the way the PlayPump has been represented to first world audiences and how it has functioned on the ground in Southern Africa. The installation draws on the artist's research for his PhD thesis 'Radical Plumbers and PlayPumps -- Objects in development', framing the way in which objects intended for developing world use, but supported by first world audiences, may be advanced more by their appeal to these audiences than for their value to developing world users.",

And this is a question of intent, of design. What if we grow health instead of sickness, home ownership instead of indigence, education instead of ignorance?\" \n\nUsing the stories of five projects that represent a revolutionary change in the direction of the human economy, THE NEXT INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION inspires people to: \nreconsider their current efforts for the environment,\n\nreinvent their businesses and institutions to work with nature,\n\nredefine themselves as consumers, producers, and citizens to promote a new sustainable relationship with the Earth.\n\nTHE NEXT INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION can be purchased in DVD or VHS video formats.\n\nThe film is a project of Earthome, a 501(c)(3) Maryland non-profit organization working to promote sustainability and environmental education.\nCategory\nNonprofits & Activism",

Community consultation, co-operation, and partnerships resulted in a successful process. The 2010 Olympics allowed the pipeline to be built at the same time as the road from Vancouver to Whistler. Renewable energy and natural gas provided a blended solution with optimal capital costs, and a flexible platform. Other subjects include Return on Investment (ROI), TNS System Conditions, Environmental Costs, and Technology Innovations.\nhttp://www.naturalstep.ca",

Based in Devon, the company helped to set up the UK's only accredited wood-fuel training course for the industry to help raise standards. It has also worked hard to ensure a reliable supply of fuel for the heating systems it installs, by supporting local wood-fuel supply businesses and pellet mills. Benefiting from the growing demand for wood-fuel -- which is now cheaper than fossil fuels -- the business is helping the UK meet its carbon reduction targets.\nCategory\nNonprofits & Activism",

Working closely with expert organisations such as WWF it has created a high-quality curriculum for its pupils which has been widely praised and replicated. An energy audit in 1999 prompted energy efficiency actions which reduced gas consumption by 30% and a solar PV array was installed on the school roof in 2005 with an electronic display that allows pupils to easily monitor its electricity generation. Other measures include 'Eco Monitors' to encourage good energy saving and a Travel Plan encouraging cycling and walking to school. There is a strong emphasis on carrying behavioural change through to the pupils' homes and local community.\nCategory\nNonprofits & Activism",

In the Embu district of central Kenya, a high rate of rainfall combined with a large amount of runoff water from the snows of Mount Kenya made hydropower the obvious choice. Through GEFs Small Grants Programme, which is managed by UNDP, the community there has established a hydro-powered turbine. Today it provides power to hundreds of people with the potential to reach thousands more.\n\nNamibia, meanwhile, is unable to receive all the energy it needs from its coal and hydropower plants to feed its rapidly growing tourism, fishing and mining industries. A UNDP/GEF initiative there is working with the Ministry of Mining and Energy to provide financing for people so they can install solar energy systems in both private homes and public buildings like schools and health clinics.\n\nIn both initiatives, the introduction of alternative sources of energy has cut down on the collection and use of biomass fuels, which cause an estimated 1.4 million people around the world to die from respiratory disease every year. The collection of firewood also leads to the destruction of vital forest lands.\n\nIn Embu, for example, people are collecting and burning firewood less and less. Instead, they are relying on the hydropower turbines output for all of their electricity needs, from simple things like cooking, television and house lights to the powering up of small businesses like a mobile phone charging shop.",

Given that only 10% of the whole population and 2% of the rural population have access to the electricity grid in Tanzania, solar energy would seem to be an obvious alternative. However, the up front costs and the problems with providing technical support to more remote areas, limits its appeal. Zara Solar has tackled this problem by selling high-quality, reliable systems at affordable prices and by creating a network of trained technicians that provide technical support to the more remote rural areas. Zara Solar and its sister company Mona-Mwanza Electrical & Electronics, have sold over 3,600 solar PV systems, directly benefiting over 18,000 people and this figure is expected to increase significantly over the coming year. In order to reach yet more people, Zara Solar is exploring micro-finance packages that will allow customers to use the savings made from replacing kerosene, to pay back the cost of the system over time.",

The video and document content herein has been collected for its relevance in supporting the maintenance and decision making process common to sustainable community development projects.\r\n\nWe are now working to provide a service based on the video library which was created over a course of 7 years or so. Please join us in taking a good look at our archive, we are just beginning now to refine and sort the videos we have into a better body of knowledge or 'Corpus', which can be used to better serve the needs of various sustainable community development projects worldwide.\r\n\nThe work of SCDHub involves 'classifying' the natural language used in the videos by closed captioned query.  We are working to use this contextual information to help improve our library, and to extract useful information from the videos so that it can be delivered to our users via different mediums, such as SMS, scheduled email courses, and via chatbot service.  If you are interested in the code we are using, most of it can be found linked from https://github.com/scdhub\r\n\n&nbsp;\n",

Johann Hari's important work helps us understand addiction as a symptom of social isolation.  If as he states, \"the opposite of addiction is not sobriety, the opposite of addiction is connection\", then sustainable community development is the only way to really address the modern crisis of opiate, alcohol and sugar addiction in modern society.\r\n\nWhat causes addiction? Easy, right? Drugs cause addiction. But maybe it is not that simple.\r\n\nThis video is adapted from Johann Hari's New York Times best-selling book 'Chasing The Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs.'

Also, he discusses the mission of the African Conservation Centre: to bring together the people and skills needed to build East Africa's capacity to conserve wildlife through sound science, local initiatives, and good governance\r\n\nAbout the speaker: Dr. David Western is the founding executive director of African Conservation Centre. Raised in Tanzania and now a Kenyan citizen, he has spent over 37 years engaged in research in Kenya studying the interactions between livestock, wildlife, and humans, with the aim of developing conservation strategies applicable at an ecosystem scale. As former director of Kenya Wildlife Service and conservation director for Wildlife Conservation Society, Dr. Western has been active in many areas of conservation, including community-based conservation, international programs, conservation planning, ecotourism, training, directing governmental and non-governmental organizations, and public education. He and his wife, Dr. Shirley Strum, spend several months each year in California, where Dr. Strum is professor of anthropology at the University of California at San Diego. Their daughter, Carissa, just completed her undergraduate degree at UC San Diego, and their son, Guy, is currently studying at UC Santa Barbara.\r\n\nhttp://www.responsibletravel.org/resources/documents/reports/TPhilConferenceKenya.pdf",

Watch BumbleFumble Founder, Danielle Bilot, present on how parking lots and other small green spaces can save the majority of our diverse, urban bees.\n\nGO NATIVE\n\nDid you know... that there are over 4000 native bee species in the U.S. alone? They are more efficient, free of cost, and the vast majority do not sting.\n\nMORE INFO\n\n HOW-TO-BEE\n\nWhether you are a homeowner, government official, or the President of the United States, there is something everyone can do to help native bees and other pollinators alike. Sign up to receive the free how-to guide on native bee habitat.\n\nMORE INFO\n\nDanielle's request to cities and people living in urban areas is to provide short range habitat for the smaller non-honey bee pollinators which have shorter ranges of flight, as well as 12-15 sq. foot minimum areas in parking lots and other open spaces. In her TED talk, she shows how native bee survival rates can be dramatically increased by ensuring that there are many more short flight range opportunities.\n\nvideo description:  \n The rapid decline of bee populations will have a devastating impact on agriculture. The problem seems insurmountable, so what can we do about it? Danielle Bilot argues that urban areas can help save the bees - it's simply a matter of design.\n\nDanielle studied landscape design at the University of Oregon and is a champion for native pollinator species. She worked on the White House Pollinator Action Plan and continues to give presentations at professional conferences around the U.S. She is passionate about teaching people how to create native bee habitats.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

In this week's podcast we speak with Francesca Dominici, professor of biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and David C. Parkes, George F. Colony Professor and area dean for computer science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Together they will lead Harvard's new Data Science Initiative, applying the theories and practices of statistics and computer science to extract useful knowledge from complex and often messy information sources. Dominici and Parkes will explain how the field of data science has grown, where it's going, and how it will affect our lives in vast ways over the coming years.\r\n\n/div\r\n/div\r\ndiv class=\"soundTags\"\r\ndiv class=\"sc-tag-group\"\"What is data science?\" , \"What is data...?  .. people often think 'numbers' but I want to make the point that data is more than/div\r\ndiv class=\"sc-tag-group\"numbers..

As of May 31, the Minnesota Department of Health had confirmed 70 cases of the disease. The outbreak is being blamed in part on anti-vaccine groups who targeted Somali-Americans, leading to a sharp drop in the number of children receiving the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In this week's podcast, we get perspective on the outbreak from childhood vaccine expert Marie McCormick, Sumner and Esther Feldberg Professor of Maternal and Child Health, at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. We spoke with McCormick about the roots of the anti-vaccine movement, as well as communications strategies to ensure that children receive critical immunizations.\r\n\nThe 'Disneyland Outbreak' is mentioned in this discussion.",

The clamp is operated by the operator pressing their feet onto a treadle bar below. A foot-actuated clamp holds the work piece securely against pulling forces, especially as when shaped with a drawknife or spokeshave.2[4]\r\n\nThe shavehorse provides a rapid and sturdy clamp, which allows the operator to use their legs and upper body weight as additional \"power\" for work. It is considered by some[by whom?] to result in less fatigue than generated by constantly standing.\r\n\nShaving green wood with the drawknife or spokeshave along the grain is far quicker and easier work than turning across it. Skilled operators can produce very fine results with a drawknife and shavehorse, requiring minimal lathe finishing.\r\n\nStraddling a shave horse while carelessly using any dangerous power tool, such as a circular saw, may result in the operator suffering serious bodily injury.\r\n\nA shave horse is the perfect tool for minimal woodworking shop setups.  Due to its low cost, it support social entrepreneurs who wish to develop their business through DIY skills.\r\n\nPlans\r\n\nhttp://www.craftsmanspace.com/sites/default/files/free-plans-pdf-files/Shaving%20horse%20plan.pdf",

However, more than a year after toxic lead levels forced a federal state of emergency in Flint, MI, 63 percent of Americans report that they worry a great deal about polluted drinking water. This statistic comes from a new Gallup poll indicating that water pollution ranks the highest of six environmental concerns among respondents. While pipes in Flint are expected to be replaced with the help of a $97 million settlement, there are other cities with histories of unsafe lead levels - or other toxins - in drinking water. These contaminants can threaten health, particularly among children. This Forum grappled with safekeeping American drinking water supplies. Does the drinking water infrastructure need replacement? How would such an effort look? Do public alert systems help? What about other potential lead exposure sources? What is the role of regulation in a time of proposed deep cuts to EPA funding? What does the public need to know?

She explained that one of the biggest challenges was to vet the abilities of people who she had hired in the past for web design, graphic, print media design, various other tech duties. She cited cash and business hour losses, and suggested that if we wanted to pursue 'Sustainable Community Development', we must develop a culture where people were more willing to be honest about their experience in said expertise.\r\n\nSEO - corroborate a proposed plan and approach with google\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piSvFxV_M04\r\n\nsix critical skills:\r\n Technical Competence\r\n Strong project management skills\r\n Excellent thinking skills\r\n Excellent ability to communicate with stakeholders\r\n Flexibility\r\n An orientation towards collaboration\r\n\n Things to raise concern:\n\nCharges supposedly from the social media website itself\nIf consultant promises of big sales and big professional successes\nGuarantees of friends, followers, and fans\nClaims that you need to be on every social media site\nDemands that you engage in advertising, press releases, etc\nunwillingness to listen to your goals and plans\r\n\nHumbleness\n\nCollaborative evaluators understand that no matter how good a job they do collecting data, you know your program better than they do. \r\n\n Developing Objectives\n\nA good consultant's proposal typically will identify:\r\n\n existing problems are (define both symptoms and causes)\r\n your expectations; needs of the group\r\n actions to be accomplished before job's completion\r\n his/her applicable experience and skills\r\n board and staff members that will be primary contacts and for what purpose\r\n time frame of work to be performed \r\n\nResources:\n\nThe 5 Essentials of Choosing a Consultant Nov 4, 2014, Doug and Polly White\nDo you need an SEO? -Maile Ohye\nWhat To Ask Before Hiring A Social Media Consultant (And When To Run Away) - http://www.webdesignrelief.com/\nHow to select and hire a consultant - includes a sample RFP and questions to ask when you are checking a consultant's resources.\n",

Simon in 1956,[3] although the concept was first posited in his 1947 book Administrative Behavior.[4 Simon used satisficing to explain the behavior of decision makers under circumstances in which an optimal solution cannot be determined. He maintained that many natural problems are characterized by computational intractability or a lack of information, both of which preclude the use of mathematical optimization procedures. Consequently, he observed in his Nobel Prize speech that \"decision makers can satisfice either by finding optimum solutions for a simplified world, or by finding satisfactory solutions for a more realistic world. Neither approach, in general, dominates the other, and both have continued to co-exist in the world of management science.\"[6]\r\n\nSimon formulated the concept within a novel approach to rationality, which posits that rational choice theory is an unrealistic description of human decision processes and calls for psychological realism. He referred to this approach as bounded rationality. Some consequentialist theories in moral philosophy use the concept of satisficing in the same sense, though most call for optimization instead.",

The tour begins at the curbside recycling bin and follows the single-stream materials to the tipping floor of the Boulder County Recycling Center. Mr. Can, the star of the show, continues the recycling journey into the high-tech world of single-stream processing. Newspaper and office paper; corrugated cardboard; aluminum cans; glass bottles and jars; plastic bottles, tubs, jugs and jars; magazines and catalogs; and phone books are separated by a series of conveyors, pre-sorts, screens, cross-belt magnet, air classifier, Eddy current separator, glass cleaning system, organic separator, and finally a fines screen and vacuum. Action video explains each step of the way and provides a behind-the-scenes, up-close view of the equipment in action. The Boulder County Recycling Center is doing its part to help Boulder County become a Zero Waste Community by 2025. Because we're all in this together, remember to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Compost!\n\n/div\r\n&nbsp;",

His father's soul was inspired by goddess of art. He became a stage conductor. He humored studying and observing the legacy of people who made history and mocking them by changing his voice and character. He fell in love while he was getting his fame with his poetry and whenever he felt like it, creating interviews by drawing out phrases in various stages. The young lady that he saw did not disappoint him. They became close.\r\n\nTeddyAfro's Father\r\n\nKassahun Germamo\r\n\nHe admired her dancing style. She praised his charming approach. Love prevailed. They longed for marriage. A music composer who heard the news of the marriage has beaten everyone to discharge the responsibility of marrying off. He folded the book of his music notes. He behaved his fingers off the piano and sang in his heart for the beloved ones.\r\n\nTilaye Arage\r\n\nTeddyAfro's Mother\r\n\nThe actor stood at the front from those who requested to be the best man. They bonded through their common stage and humor. It made them to be close to each other. Stage performing continued. Months have gone while the stage host with his words and style, his wife with her dancing skill, the music composer with his ear pleasing melody and the actor with his act of his stage character glow the stage.\r\n\nThe 16 years old stage dancer became pregnant. After a while, she gave birth to a baby boy. She and her husband who were devoted for art, the composer who made the marriage possible and the actor who was the best man only tried to show their talent and told they were won over by what they have loved but have not foretold the boy's life journey nor his destiny. The mother hasn't wondered around looking for a name for her son nor has she pleaded for the help of others. She was gazing at the painting on the wall. She has been to Debrezeit before she gave birth. The painter has given her the painting of Atse Theodros. She muttered a sound while her eyes were fixed at the painting. She called out for her husband.\r\n\nBaby Teddy\r\nBaby Teddy\r\n\n\"Kassahun....Kassa! ...\" she thought of her husband's name and named her son Theodros. Theodros Kassahun grew up. He was titled the first born. He celebrated his fifth birthday. The mother was not present at his sixth birthday. The couple began to live separately. Father took the responsibility of raising the child.\r\n\nThe boy grew tall. His age increased. The little boy understood his father's wish in his big heart. He knew he favored him. He noticed his silence at home and entertaining character outside home.\r\n\nThe mother left her dancing career and became an office secretary while the father became a radio journalist leaving his stage hosting career. The boy who saw his mother dancing in television and who heard his father's humor and his narrating style in radio was consumed by the feeling he had for art. At the gate of his adolescence, he wrote a whole exercise book of poetry and took it to his mother. She didn't mind him much when he showed it to her.\r\n\nHe went home and tried to express his love for music to his father. He didn't encourage him. Both of his parents have recalled their years on a stage. They have elevated audience of that time. Their only remaining treasure was the audiences' and listeners' admiration and their only fame was of the price they have paid for art. They didn't want their legacy to be his.\r\n\nThe father tried to convince the child as the son grew with age and physique. He tried to encourage him telling him his wish and showing him the way he has to walk through.\r\n\nTeddy - Rising Star!\r\n\nThe child fell in love with music secretly. He created music out of the life of his parents who went through art.\r\n\nHe went out of the way of the standard love lyrics and singing style. Just like other listeners, he pleased the heart of his mother and father yet from the beginning.\r\n\nWhile he sang \"tizita\", his mother was accompanying her sister who was in bed sick. She was surprised when she saw him and stunned when she heard him sing. She found herself without knowing it beneath the television before he finished his song.\r\n\nThe father was taken back by his only son's song more than the crime investigation stories he narrates in the radio. He knew everything before few days. He didn't press him like before.\r\n\nHe traveled outside Addis for business. When returned he was sick and was diagnosed with meningitis. He was treated. It was just after the recovery that he heard his son's song for the first time.\r\n\nHe shared his happiness with his friends calmly. He was proud when they admired his son. When the boy's songs were heard across the country with his unique lyrics and melody and when listeners admired and praise his songs, his father had already passed away. He continued creating lyrics, melody and backing melodies. He aggressively continued to work for himself and for others. His devotion showered him with love.\r\n\nNo one has foretold his life's journey.\r\n\nNo one predicted his destiny.\r\n\nIn addition to his father, the five artists, the man that made their marriage possible; Colonel Ayalew Abebe and his best man the stage actor of Hager Fiker Theatre, Fiseha Haile have also passed away.\r\n\nThe painter Lema Guya aside giving his mother, Tilaye Arage the painting of Atse Theodros, has never thought that it would be the name of her son.\r\n\nThe actor who was the best man and the music composer who made the marriage possible has never predicted a famous artist will be born aside having done what they did in the name of love and marriage. The five artists were not aware that an art was born.\n",

He believes that gardening has the power to change the world.\r\n\nA social activist since his youth in the 1960s, Embry believes that community gardening is the most important social movement in the country. Through workshops, tours, presentations, and service projects, Embry connects community gardeners-from the private and public sector-to the earth and each other. Dave Shuffett visits with Embry in Lexington and looks at several community gardens.\r\n\nCommunity gardens are located in city parks as well as on school grounds and even in road medians. Local governments promote community gardens as a way to provide fresh food for low-income residents and to beautify the area. Gardens also improve the environment: In Lexington, a rain garden of trees and perennial flowers at Limestone, Vine and Main streets catches rainwater.\r\n\nEmbry, who holds a degree in biology, served as executive director of the Boggs Center to Nurture Community Leadership in Detroit for four years before returning to Kentucky in 2005. He has been a three-time U.S. delegate to Terra Madre, a biannual gathering in Italy for members of Slow Food International. \r\n\nPublished on Apr 3, 2014\r\nSUBSCRIBE 5.2K\r\n\nfrom http://www.kentucky.com/living/home-garden/article44613195.html \r\n\nFormerly the Bluegrass Domestic Violence Program, Greenhouse 17 is a shelter for victims of intimate partner abuse, where survivors can grow, flourish and leave the trauma of violence behind. Smith is a resident.\r\n\nThe program moved in 2005 from Lexington to 40 acres of beautiful farmland on Briar Hill Road. That move triggered a serendipitous chain of events that significantly changed the agency.\r\n\n\"At that time, our funding was being slashed,\" said Christina Lane, farm-to-table coordinator for Greenhouse 17. \"Everybody was concerned. Diane Fleet, our assistant director, said, 'We have 40 acres. Why don't we farm?'\"\r\n\nFleet attended a conference sponsored by the Kentucky Coalition Against Domestic Violence, where Jim Embry spoke.\r\n\nEmbry, a Kentuckian, lived several years in Detroit and worked as a community activist, using his passion for urban agriculture to help young people, gang members and teen moms \"transform themselves as individuals, and transform their communities through youth activism, like in the 1960s,\" he said.\r\n\nWhen Embry moved back to Lexington, he brought his activist spirit, with the focus always on gardening, the environment, food and nature. He organized the Sustainable Community Network and promoted community gardens among churches, with the city parks department, neighborhood associations, Fayette County Public Schools, the Martin Luther King Academy and Chrysalis House. He gave workshops, wrote a manual on community gardens and spoke to civic organizations, urging them to organize community gardens.",

The library is a product of Bernard Amadei's graduate students contributions while in the Sustainability in the Built Environment class over a course of 8 years.  While available as 'approvideo.org' our library has since been used as part of the professional resources ACME makes available to its members. \r\n\nWe are now looking at our library with fresh eyes and beginning to build a documents section for files which are particularly insightful about aspects of sustainable community development.  Students are vulnerable to huge student debt if they are not careful to win scholarships and work study (coop-ing) opportunities.  It is our hope that training resources we offer through our apps and website, email lists, print media, and direct mailings will make a difference in how people are able to prepare themselves for a productive career rooted in sustainable community development technique and technology.\r\n\ncommunities are more able to generate wealth, maintain or improve their competitive position, preserve and use community resources and adapt to change (Shaffer, 1989).\r\n\nSpecifically:\r\n• An expanded, diverse, inclusive citizen participation base\r\n• An expanded leadership base\r\n• Strengthened individual skills\r\n• A widely shared, understood and agreed local or regional vision for the future\r\n• A strategic community agenda (ie a widely agreed strategic plan)\r\n• Consistent, tangible progress toward community goals\r\n• More effective community organizations\r\n• Better use of resources.

I replaced the soundtrack with the song \"Washintu\" by Ethiopian singer Gigi. Her hypnotic sound blends well with the footage.\r\n\nTrinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie is a 1995 American documentary film directed by Peter Kuran and narrated by William Shatner. Using restored archive footage, the film traces the development of nuclear weapons and their testing, from America's Trinity test of 1945 (hence the title) to the first Chinese atomic bomb test in 1964. Kuran's commentary on the DVD version states that the DVD replaces some of the original footage with better-quality versions. There are some short special effects sequences too. The film has also since been released on Blu-ray.\r\nIncluded is footage of nuclear tests starting with the May 1945 trial run to Trinity (the first atomic bomb), a 100 ton TNT blast used to scale and calibrate the Trinity device, and ending with the last U.S. atmospheric nuclear detonation (called Tightrope) of the Nike Hercules air defense missile in 1963. Also included are test series in the South Pacific, and footage of the firing of the U.S. Army's atomic cannon at the Nevada Test Site in 1953, and color images of multi-megaton high altitude air bursts over Johnston Island just before the limited test ban treaty went into effect (banning all except underground detonations) in 1963.\r\nThe film's footage is newly declassified and previously unseen. Kuran's research brought him into contact with many of the cameramen who photographed the American tests, leading to the production of another documentary, Atomic Filmmakers which featured their reminiscences of working on the program. A new patented image restoration process was used for the first time to improve considerably the image quality of old and fading film stock.\r\nThe film's music (composed by William Stromberg) was performed by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra, symbolizing the end of the cold war. The score was later used in some trailers for the X-Men movies.\r\nFootage from a Soviet documentary about the tsar bomba is featured in Trinity and Beyond, where it is referred to as the Russian monster bomb. The movie states that the Tsar Bomba project broke the voluntary moratorium on nuclear tests. In fact Soviets restarted their tests and broke the unilateral voluntary moratorium two months before Tsar Bomba, and since the moratorium was unilateral there was no multilateral legal obstacle (earlier the U.S. also declared a one year unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests and as that year expired the US had already announced that it considered itself free to resume testing without further notice but had not resumed tests until the aftermath of Tsar Bomba).\r\nCategory\r\nMusic\r\nLicense\r\nStandard YouTube License\r\nSuggested by AdShare MG for a Third Party\r\nPlan B - Si No Le Contesto [Official Video]",

Ned's eco pass is free for people living in the library district. The Gold Hill 'Climb' is supposedly funded privately, and Gold Hill is part of unincorporated Boulder County, so we could try to tap into and expand the same fund to get Gold Hill residents free transit option like Ned residents have.\r\n\n: a project-centric SCD Hub clinic...\r\n\nThe next meeting of this clinic is being planned to support Heather and Jim's vison of a tiny house.

Heather expressed concerns over whether any home insulation standards might effect them in the form of regulation when in Canada. Greg didn't think that there would be any 'hard requirements' for tiny house insulation standards to meet in place because tiny houses are mobile and generally not subject to the same building codes, but since you never know, it might be smart to consider meeting the 'superinsulated home' standards of r55 wall and ceiling insulations, and minimally the R19 standard we have here. Since Heather and Jim's tiny house is to be used in the mountains of Colorado, it doesn't hurt to go for the R55 standard.  Greg pointed out that he was able to get high quality insulating material from Boulder Craigslist, and that R55 wasn't an impossible standard to meet- that air to air heat exchangers can be employed as demonstrated in this video.\r\n\nresources:\r\n\nEthan Waldman's Tiny House On Wheels in Vermont website offers a free ebook \r\n and book/interview video collection \"Tiny House Decisions\" you can purchase as well.\r\n\nSkip the Trailer: 13 Tiny Houses Built on Foundations  \n\nHow to Avoid Having a Ladder in Your Tiny House\r\nHow to Finance a Tiny House",

Although neither a politician nor activist, Guthrie brought attention to the plight of Okies, migrant workers and other disenfranchised people. He gave music a social conscience and influenced several generations of singer-songwriters, including Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, Steve Earle, John Mellencamp, Ani DiFranco and Jeff Tweedy. The film uses Guthrie's own voice from Library of Congress recordings, as well as archival footage from the '30s.

One easy-to-clean vessel, a step up to the next level - one love for the 'buch.\r\nDiscrete and heavy duty, this crock will last a lifetime, and your mother will love her roomy new home.

Establishing the so called community conservancies in Northern Kenya, without full involvement, awareness creation and participation of pastoralist and indigenous peoples in this massive land and pastures grab in the name of conservation must be challenged and condemned in our county assemblies. Future generations will hold us accountable for letting this to happen. Present day conservationists are erstwhile hunters and trophy collectors with smoking guns in their hands! New conservancies sideline legally established institutions such as the Kenya Wildlife Service, and come under the umbrella of Trusts, and a further chameleonic colour of NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS...A clever way of evading tax and channel tourists to privately owned conservancies! Haven't we seen  this replayed over and over again in Zimbabwe, where whites held 70% of the best arable land in the name of private farms, ranches and wildlife conservancies? The Kenya 2010 Constitution has legalized dual citizenship and opened a plethora of unending conflict between the new 'apostles of conservation' and local pastoralist peoples.﻿",

Why? After traveling around the world and seeing many cities from different cultures, Mark realized that one thing was missing from American cities: squares and plazas. Americans don't connect on the streets because there's no place to do so. Streets are designed for motorized traffic. Intersections aren't made to hang out. So Mark's \"Communitecture\" firm created a project called \"City Repair\". The idea: create beautiful spots all around town, built and designed in part by residents so that they would have a place to enjoy and hang out. One site at a time, Mark is helping people create their own original landmarks that will make them love their cities and know each other more./div\r\ndiv/div\r\ndivhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DGE9BtSK4Q/div\n",

I have to break off all the little plastic clips so it sits on the mount much better. Planning on changing around some of the older busbars to make them work more efficiently. Powerwall is now sitting at 30kWh and been upgraded to 48v 4000w system and still growing. In hindsight I wouldn't be using any cells under 2100mah\r\n\n&nbsp;\r\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4ggDN7290&list=PLVtgHS9JItetT8JVGvoK3OBy7sYm3Xwj\r\n\nHow to capacity test an 18650 cell out of a laptop battery pack does! After many requests, i've tried to put this little tutorial as sweet and simple as possible showing how I remove cells from the laptop battery packs to tested cells. It should be noted that I did not include Internal Resistance testing as I don't do it. My tests with my equipment result in wildly different results that can't be trusted.\r\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iejGerJ04Sg\r\n\nThis is follow on from the last video trying to run through the basics, if there is any thing I've missed or you'd like to know please ask in the comments I'll try to release it in the next video Quick run down on building 18650 80P cells from just after processing them and sorting the good 18650's from the bad to how the cells are soldered together.\r\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5jmCyQSvi8\r\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUTt4Vx0rCg\r\n\nFake 18650 Cells drive me nuts. I consider a fake(d) cell to be any cell that has anything other than the exact capacity on or around it. So all the shit all over eBay that has 4000, 6000, 10,000mah on it doesn't exist in the real world and it's said all they are is \"our\" recycled cells they just rewrap or there are even reports of 18650 cells being full of sand to make them up to the correct weight. Who knows but I hope this really helps someone out there in interwebs land :)\r\n\n&nbsp;\r\n\n■▬▬▬▬▬ Links ▬▬▬▬▬■\r\n\nMH12210 ncr18650B Cells%20UK.html)\r\n\n18650 wall mounts - https://goo.gl/xDUzSV\r\n\nBatrium BMS - http://www.batrium.com\r\n\n■▬▬▬▬▬HBPowerwall ▬▬▬▬▬■\r\n\n► Forum : http://www.diypowerwalls.com/t-HBPowe...\r\n\n► Website : http://www.hbpowerwall.com (Links to YouTube)\r\n\n► Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/hbpowerwall\r\n\n► Twitter : http://twitter.com/hbpowerwall\r\n\n► Insta : https://www.instagram.com/hbpowerwall",

Soil erosion results in the loss of soil and loss of usable land. If left unmanaged erosion will result in gullies.  It is important to manage erosion in order to prevent the loss of valuable soil and to maintain the area of usable land. One technique for managing soil erosion and gullies is the construction of check dams.   The check dams trap the sediment behind the check dam and slowly reclaim the land. This also helps to prevent downstream impacts. Eventually the land can be reused. There are different types of check dams depending on the severity of the gully and the rate of flow of the water e.g. simple vegetation barriers, to more hardy stone based check dams. This video demonstrates how to construct check dams in erosion channels or for gully reclamation.",

Primary settling tanks are usually equipped with mechanically driven scrapers that continually drive the collected sludge towards a hopper in the base of the tank where it is pumped to sludge treatment facilities.[7]:9--11 Grease and oil from the floating material can sometimes be recovered for saponification. Screening: The influent sewage water passes through a bar screen to remove all large objects like cans, rags, sticks, plastic packets etc. carried in the sewage stream.[6] This is most commonly done with an automated mechanically raked bar screen in modern plants serving large populations, whilst in smaller or less modern plants, a manually cleaned screen may be used. The raking action of a mechanical bar screen is typically paced according to the accumulation on the bar screens and/or flow rate. The solids are collected and later disposed in a landfill, or incinerated. Bar screens or mesh screens of varying sizes may be used to optimize solids removal. If gross solids are not removed, they become entrained in pipes and moving parts of the treatment plant, and can cause substantial damage and inefficiency in the process.[7]:9 Grit removal: Pretreatment may include a sand or grit channel or chamber, where the velocity of the incoming sewage is adjusted to allow the settlement of sand, grit, stones, and broken glass. These particles are removed because they may damage pumps and other equipment. For small sanitary sewer systems, the grit chambers may not be necessary, but grit removal is desirable at larger plants.[7] Grit chambers come in 3 types: horizontal grit chambers, aerated grit chambers and vortex grit chambers.

As a community, we need to consider our demand for water, the water supply options available to us and the way we operate the SEQ Water Grid.\r\n\nFor more info, visit www.seqwater.com.au/waterforlife",

This shows the well cap/head.  The jack runs a sucker rod up and down pumping water 90 feet below in a well cylinder.  Have to unbolt the head and see what kind of seals are in it.  Leaked some, then froze at the top and now leaks too much!\r\n\ncommment: There are still folks in rural areas who use pumpjacks, and so local well drillers and repair folks often have extra ones on hand.  I ended up replacing my well with a more modern pump and gave the old pumpjack to the well driller as he said he still fixed them and could use it for parts or replacement.  So contact your local rural well repairman and he will likely know about them.﻿ - RiverRoadRambler - 2 months ago",

NOW NEARLY ONE MILLION GALLONS OF UNTREATED AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS WASTEWATER HAS SPILLED IN THIS THAT CHARLES CREEK SECTION OF THE PASQUOTANK RIVER. ABOUT ONE MILLION GALLONS OF WASTEWATER INTO THE STREETS AND A LOCAL CREEK. OFFICIALS SAY IT WAS NOT CAUSED BY BAD TYPES, BUT MOTHER NATURE. THE SEWAGE WATER IS OUT OF THE STREETS. PEOPLE STOPPING BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON SAY THEY ARE NOT GOING BY THE WATER ANYTIME SOON. I THINK IT IS BAD, BUT IF IT IS UNDER CONTROL, THAT IS GOOD NEWS. I DO NOT WANT THEM GETTING IN IT. KNOWING THERE WAS WASTEWATER, THE KIDS WERE NOT GOING TO SCHOOL TODAY. I THINK IT IS GROSS. CITY OFFICIALS SAY PEOPLE DO NOT NEED TO BE CONCERNED. THE VOLUME IN THE PASQUOTANK RIVER IS VERY SMALL, AND IT WAS DILUTED BY RAINWATER. THE OVERFLOW HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER 21. THE CITY'S TREATMENT FACILITY WAS OVER ITS CAPACITY. IT IS EQUIPPED TO DEAL UP TO 3 MILLION GALLONS, BUT ON THE 21ST IT SAW BETWEEN 12 MILLION AND 14 MILLION GALLONS OF WATER. THAT IS WHY THEY SOUGHT GOING INTO THE CREEK. IT FLOWED ACROSS THE ROAD, WHEREVER THE RAIN WAS GOING. SOME PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO TAKE CHANCES. MY FIANCE WANTED TO GO FISHING TODAY. WE ARE NOT GOING FISHING. SHE SAID SHE HOPES IT DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. THAT IS A LOT OF SEWAGE./elitetoggle\r\n\n&nbsp;",

Put contaminated water in a pail and bring the water to a boil. Leave it boiling for about a minute. At the end of a minute the water will be ready to drink,. Lot of people keep the water boiling for longer. This does not help as the water will not get any hotter, it will only evaporate. At higher altitudes, water takes longer to boil, so keep it boiling for about five minutes. ",

Most are to be achieved by the year 2030. One is targeted for 2020.[27]\n\nThe first three targets relate to drinking water supply and sanitation.[27] Safe drinking water and hygienic toilets protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption is critical to successful education and successful employment. Therefore, toilets in schools and work places are specifically mentioned as a target to measure. \"Equitable sanitation\" is called for and calls for addressing the specific needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities. Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented.\n\nEnding open defecation will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as behavior change of the users.[28] This will require cooperation between governments, civil society and the private sector.[29]\n\nThe main indicator for the sanitation target is the \"Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water\".[30] The current statistic in the 2017 baseline estimate by the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) is that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation.[28]",

How can 12 Volt, G4 LED's (12V AC/DC G4 Led Bulb/Lamp) be mounted in existing  substructure spot lights?\r\nAn energy saving of 85% can be reached. Make sure you use the right leds. The current available LEDS are very different in characteristics like: lumen, colour temperature. Even if you buy 5 LED'-lamps from the same manufacturer their can be a difference in colour and the amount of lumen emitted. Some  LED's make an amount of noise. If you need to replace halogen lamps of 20 Watt, 12 Volt, you need LEDs of about 150 lumen. \r\nIn some cases existing transformer must be replaced as well. Existing transformers can have a minimum load of for instance 50 Watt, but the LED load in my case was only 15 Watt\r\n230V AC to 12 Volt DC transformers (15 Watt) can be bought for around € 10,-. De LED modules (warm white: 2700K) are available for about € 17,- a piece. The new version however only costs you arround € 7,- (Corpro LEDCapsuleLV G4 827)\r\nHow to upgrade Halogen Downlights to Energy Efficient LED Lighting? With the MASTER LEDcapsuleLV 3-20W G4 827 or\r\nMASTER LEDcapsuleLV 3-20W 827 G4 (This one is not available any more so you should choose the Corpro LEDCapsuleLV 2-20W G4 827. Make shure you do not choose the dimmable version since this one is to high (48mm) and costs more.\r\nThe MASTER LEDcapsule radiates warm light in all directions, making\r\nit a true alternative for the halogen capsule. It is particularly suitable\r\nfor task lighting and decorative applications in homes, shops, hotels\r\nand restaurants. Compatible with existing fixtures with G4 holders\r\nand designed for retrofit replacement of halogen capsules, MASTER LEDcapsule delivers huge energy savings and minimizes maintenance\r\ncosts without any compromise on light quality. The patented\r\nintelligent driver in the 2.5-10W version enables broad compatibility\r\nwith existing electromagnetic and electronic halogen transformers.",

These easy solutions will help you to fix a toilet that is constantly running and costing you money on your water bill.\r\n\nThe three most common problems that cause toilet to run constantly are:\r\n\nA leaky flapper - This is as easy as buying a new $6 flapper that fits your toilet brand and replacing in under 5 minutes.\r\nFloat problems - This could mean that the chain is getting stuck in between your flapper and the bottom of the tank or that the float is set too high. If the chain is getting stuck, simply trim it or clip the end to the clip that hold the chain to the flush lever. If the float is set too high you will know because the water will constantly flow into the overflow tube. Check out the video to see how to lower the float.\r\nA broken or defective fill valve - If you still hear that annoying sound of water running you might want to pick up a new fill valve. This is a pretty easy DIY project and will save you tons by doing it yourself.

This is an overview of a residential project here in Ohio.  The site had just been inspected by the Health Department, so we had all our trenches open and thought it would be a good opportunity to put together a video for reference.  \r\n\nIt is important to note that we typically do not make hard connections to the tank (either with the pump supply line or the tank inlet and outlet) until the tank has been backfilled and compacted to the levels of the pipe connections.  However, this particular county health department inspector requested that the pit be exposed and the connections be made for the inspection.  Also, you'll see that there is water in the pit under the tank.  This is groundwater that seeped in during excavation.... It was not put there by us and, no, we don't have a cracked or leaking tank.

7074 ' Duration in seconds:807 ' Characters per second: 8.77\r\n\nthis is the story of Sabina Sabina is much like me we are both mothers who work hard taking care of our families but there's one big difference between Sabina and me since the age of seven Sabina has gone to the river nearly every day to fetch water I stayed with Sabina for 24 hours to watch how she used her time and how she used water I watched as her day began at sunrise and throughout the day as she cared for her husband Jacob a farmer who raised his livestock I watched as she mothered her children including her new baby I saw how water was part of every aspect of Sabinas day and how if she wasn't using water she was walking to get it when that David AVI a four mile round-trip walk to a dirty river where she scoops water from a hole twice a day with her best friend Christina and I realized I couldn't truly understand what it was like to walk and Sabina shoes unless I did it myself no it's light right now maybe later it was very heavy this fence is just one of the many obstacles that the women face as they're going to the river that's the other obstacles our forms are everywhere they're above us they're below us step on thorns my hair gets caught in thorns and the water itself is an obstacle it's an obstacle to a girl's future because they have to get water all the time they're not getting education they're going to the river look there's what there's a container there okay it looks like somebody got water from here yeah geez that thing is full water is not just scarce here it's really really yucky people come to the water source we're right next to just because it's so much easier to get water from here than to go all the way to the river but this kind of water is just a breeding ground for typhoid and cholera and waterborne diseases that cause diarrhea in fact just last night Sabina and Jacob had to take the baby to the health clinic Jude fever and then she vomited and had diarrhea every 10 minutes she had to have an IV for 24 hours okay I got it neither rock in my shoe the closer the closer I get to the river the more nervous I get because I don't know if I'm gonna be able to carry this water this could be extremely embarrassing okay and there's well oh my goodness we just got the go-ahead to the river Mary ran ahead to warn the women who are bathing there here goes nothing it's ten after three we left at ten after two it's taken us an hour to get here the water is today a bit browner than the other day we were here so we need to scoop another hole to get water kay you show me and I'll do it okay it looks pretty Brown make the hole bigger with our hands okay so now we're just getting this dirty water out of the hole that we dug oopsie we had a little landfill that incident here sorry that was my father when I was in a spelling bee I lost on the word arduous I'm still not sure how to spell it but now I know what it means I know this water is not good it looks okay but it's not okay the little health clinic we went to today average is ten kids a day and this water is a big part of the reason they go so we brought a scale along so we can weigh these it's so happy can you read the scale 57 for the big 157 pounds and the little one oh it's so light 15 pounds for the little one so 57 plus 13 is 70 pounds yeah so now for the hard part Christina and Sabina are going home to me to put this on my back and carry it the two miles home but it was awful and the worst part of it is I have a huge audience watching me okay this is I gotta say a little prayer first okay this to the side thank to the knees beneath then up okay I can't really get to the need this is too heavy to really get to the knees oh okay come on knees yeah okay then the up part so I get up now oh I feel like a Russian weightlifter mm-hmm all right then what do we do we put that one on here hey that came in more than a lakh yeah oh yeah yep that's 70 pounds its 355 and I've just started and I'm already tired the straps are digging into my shoulders I think this would be the longest hour of my life I'll just stand here for just a second just a second I'll just rest for one second I know we're not to the resting place yet I can do this I can do this we can do this I can't go to the dentist but I can do this okay let's go oh one thing the lady said to me is they hate how they get back aches when they do this they say the pain just builds and builds as they go and go and it takes a while for their back to stop aching when they get home I can feel it I can feel my back aching oops except we just started thank you so much Christina got me some kindling to use as a walking stick which is nice feel like Moses now with the Red Sea on my back Sabina makes this trip twice a day she uses about 13 gallons a day that's for everything cooking cleaning drinking bathing and so in this trip I'm carrying half of the water she was today one of the most poignant stories Sabina told me was how she had seen running water once in her life was three years ago it was in place called laylan which has water it has Springs and people have water right in their yards and she went from house to house to see this incredible sight this water that came right from a tap that she didn't have to get from the river and she said I never knew that there were places that weren't like this and once I was there I didn't want to come back I'm Sabina about her dreams her children it would be well yet even on and her dream is that they would all get an education the education she never got because she had to fetch water and then I asked her what her dream for herself is and she said I just like to be able to take a bath at my house know the game I have to go across the gate because there's storm brushes on either side and as I'm going across the gate I'm remembering House of Mina went across this gate every day she was pregnant including the day she gave birth if she can do it nine months pregnant I can do it at forty seven maybe Robin no no what I can do this oh ouch hey oh yeah I can get up there right there oh my foot doesn't really move like that when you done okay then then what do I do okay that this leg has to oh yeah okay then what getting down I've always thought about water in terms of disease how if you don't have water or if you have bad water you get sick and you can die but I have a new understanding of water now it's not just about disease if you don't have water it robbed you of time it robs you of education Sabina didn't get to go to school and now because she has to go for hours every day to get this water she doesn't have the time that she wants to spend with her family and do the things that she actually wants to do like plant a kitchen garden and that doesn't seem too much to ask to me so my wish for Sabina today is that water will come close to her so she won't be chained to that river anymore and she'll get back the time that she deserves and needs to have a full life would you like some water Gary Ghana dog Regan and Fanning Ali Ali no gimme gana Sabha yog okay League an answer on okay Regan and polygon on\r\n\n/div\r\n/div\r\n",

does it all work can anything go down there are there even any rules and is the sink any different the bathroom sink the kitchen sink actually there is no difference sink toilets same thing behind these walls and under these floors all the drains meet up in a single pipe and head toward the sewers and going about our everyday lives we use a lot of water for drinking washing cooking going to the toilet and much more by using this water it becomes polluted the wastewater we produce is known as sewage everything that leaves the house through the main drain pipe meets up with the sewer right down here in some places to combine sewer both wastewater and storm water in other words everything from inside your house and everything from outside your house brain whatever goes into a single combined sewer offices shops factories and other industries together with rain water that runs off roofs and roads sewage is washed flushed or drained into sewers the underground network of sewers that collect all this wastewater and transports it to the sewage works is known as the sewerage system in the area it drains is the catchment area all of it heads towards the wastewater treatment plant in some places the sewers are separated one for wastewater and the other for storm water in that case only the wastewater heads towards the wastewater treatment plant the storm sewer goes straight to the river untreated because it's only water right actually no it isn't all the chemicals that you put on your lawn or the soap with all the phosphates that you wash your car with all head out the storm sewer if you've got a separated system straight into the room all the wastewater fins up at moist water treatment plants originally established by the Royal Commission on sewage disposal 1898 1915 objectives of sewerage treatment had as follows to avoid pestilence and nuisance disease and odor the protection of potable water sources from pollution by sewerage discharge and to produce effluence which after dilution with with water a suitable for abstraction as sources of potable supply sewage is a complex mixture of suspended and dissolved materials both categories constitute organic pollution the strength of sewage and the quality of sewage effluent are described in terms of their suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand these two measures were originally either proposal devised by the Royal Commission the suspended solids are determined by way after the filtration of a known volume of sample through a standard glass fiber filter paper the results being expressed in milligrams per liter dissolved pollutants are determined by the biochemical oxygen demand they exert when incubated for five days at twenty degrees Celsius samples require appropriate dilution with oxygen saturated water and suitable replication the oxygen consumed is determined and the results are get expressed in milligrams per litre the two standards for sewage effluent quality proposed by the Royal Commission or for no more than 30 milligrams per liter of suspended solids and 20 milligrams per litre for biochemical oxygen demand the so-called 30 to 20 standard the Royal Commission in visits that the effluent of this standard would be diluted 8 to 1 with clean river water having biochemical oxygen demand of 2 milligrams per litre or less this standard was considered to be the normal minimum requirement and was not enforced by statute because the character and use of rivers varied so greatly currently most sewage treatment works are required to meet discharge standards set by the urban waste water treatment directive the flow of sanitary sewage alone in the absence of storms in dry season is known as dry weather flow DWF the purpose of these plans is to remove all solids and pathogens you know microorganisms like bacteria and stuff from the wastewater so when it gets reintroduced to the river it's cleaner than when it arrived at the wastewater treatment plant when it arrives coarse screens remove large solids rags and debris from wastewater and are immediately disposed of it's here that you see some of the most ridiculous things people have put down their toilets drains and sewers at least this stuff made it this far some things that the water can't dissolve end up stuck in the sewers leading to sewers being clogged and homes being flooded after those fine screens are used to remove the smaller material in the same way next up is grit removal grit includes sand gravel and other heavy solid materials that are heavier than the organic solids in the wastewater removal of grit happens by getting the wastewater to flow in a spiral pattern heavier particles settle at the bottom of the tank while lighter organic particles are suspended and eventually carried out of the tank from there that water is sent into a settling basin this is where suspended solids settle out and floating scum is removed by skimmers scrapers in the tank moved continuously along the bottom to deposit the raw sludge into hoppers which is sent to a nearby plant where it's made into pellets for fertilizer after the settling basins the wastewater is sent to the next step by a Archimedes screw pump which forces the liquid upwards the revolutions raise the water thread by thread until it comes out at the top of the cylinder there it is met by the fine curve screen where small items that have made it through the initial screening process are removed things like fruit and vegetable stickers they don't dissolve and they clog up the system so when you're pilling them off throw them in the garbage not down the sink now it's time to get the stuff you can't see some of this work is done by biological aerated filters essentially what happens here is that good microorganisms attached to porous rock eat up the bad microorganisms the waste water is pumped up through the rocks and the bacteria in the water sticks to the rocks bubbles are pumped in to keep the good bacteria alive and working the clean water goes up in the rocks with the bad bacteria attached to them go back down this cleansed water then flows into a channel on its way to be treated by ultraviolet light the water passes high output UV lamps where light disrupts the molecular structure of DNA molecules and the micro organisms this renders the cells unable to replicate before they die the disinfection stage takes seconds eliminates the need for chlorine and makes the final process much safer let's look now at the sewage treatment process a sewage works such as this treats nearly 40,000 cubic meters of mainly domestic sewage each day at this site trade waste from two local food manufacturers comprises about 8% of the total flow rainwater runoff referred to a surface flow is also treated for simplicity we will refer to all the incoming waste waters as sewage that the sewage treatment works the incoming waste passes through screens which remove large pieces of debris such as plastic paper and cloth the liquid then flows through a number of channels which take out any grit washed in from roads the raw sewage entering the works passes through six millimeter mesh screens the collected solid matter is called screenings and typically comprises rags cotton buds sanitary products and paper the screenings are compacted and sent to landfill the sewage then flows to a grit extractor of the cross-flow type we Road grit and other inorganic matter settle out this material is subsequently washed and also sent to landfill the sewage is then passed forward to large tanks here fine particles sink to the bottom and form a sludge which is regularly removed and further treated on leaving the grit extractor the sewage enters the primary settlement tanks here approximately 70% of the remaining solid matter settles out and forms primary sludge which collects in a sump at the bottom of the tank periodically the sludge is pumped away for disposal or for treatment above this sludge lies the waste water it now has a greatly reduced amount of suspended solids and with it about 30% less biochemical oxygen demand or VOD for short here we use bacteria to clean up the liquid sewage the bacteria help purify the liquid by actively feeding on it and turning most of it into carbon dioxide water and nitrogen in biological filters we encourage bacteria to grow in deep beds of irregularly shaped stones gaps between the stones circulate air which lets the bacteria breathe and thrive that the liquid passes through them an alternative to biological filters is a process called activated sludge where air is bubbled through the sewage to encourage bacteriological growth the air can then be pumped or entrained from the surface by rotating paddles either way once the bacteria have done their work the liquid goes into further settling tanks to remove the remaining particles leaving clean water to flow to the river or if necessary onward to further treatment on this site the wastewater is treated in one of three different types of biological system namely biological filters activated sludge units or oxygen ditches first there were only the biological filters but over the years the activated sludge unit and oxygen ditches were installed here you can see the rectangular biological filters in many works they're circular but irrespective of their shape biological filters are robust and easy to operate microorganisms growing on the clinker in the bed break down the organic matter in the effluent on leaving the filters the effluent is dosed with ferric sulfate in order to precipitate out the phosphates this prevents eutrophication occurring in the river when the treated effluent is finally discharged at the end of the process the effluent then goes to a humours tank for secondary settlement where microbial solids and precipitated phosphates settle out and are removed a sludge you can see that the water looks much cleaner than it was at the inlet an alternative to the biological filter is the activated sludge unit here the wastewater is aerated and mixed by fine bubbles of air blown through hundreds of ceramic or plastic diffusers such as this the organic matter in the sewage is again broken down by microorganisms but this time they're suspended in the mixed liquor in a tank the remaining system is the oxygen ditch where almost one-fifth of the sewage at this plant is treated interestingly the oxygen ditch doesn't require primary settlement the sewage is aerated with the help of large brush raters and the effluent moves around the ditch allowing the organic matter to be degraded by microbes in suspension on exiting it goes to a settlement tank and then to the gravel filter treated effluent from all three systems comes together before discharge into the nearby river you simplistic terms nitrogen in various forms is flushed rinsed or otherwise introduced into the sewer system almost all of this organic nitrogen urea for example is immediately hydrolyzed into ammonia in water gaseous ammonia nh3 is almost entirely converted to ionized ammonia or ammonium nh4 plus specialized autotrophic bacteria or nitrifiers convert the ammonium to nitrite no.2 and then to nitrate no.3 through various biological processes as dissolved oxygen is depleted by the nitrifiers and other organisms in the basin other specialized heterotrophic bacteria d nitrifiers are able to thrive by using the oxygen attached to the nitrate molecules for respiration creating nitrogen gas as a by-product the nitrogen gas then simply bubbles out of the water into the atmosphere pretty slick right well let's go back to the beginning and take a closer look at each of these important steps in the nitrogen removal process first as a natural reaction in an aqueous solution or in water the vast majority of the organic nitrogen immediately hydrolyzes into ammonia most of this ammonia automatically converts to the ionic form ammonium the equilibrium between the gaseous and ionic forms of ammonia is heavily impacted by the pH of the water a more acidic solution will favour the ionic form ammonium a more basic will favor the gaseous form ammonia since wastewater typically ranges between a pH of 6 and 9 almost all of the ammonia will be in the ionic form since ammonia testing accounts for both forms ionic and gaseous it is not necessary to worry about each form separately no bacteria is necessary for this conversion it just happens the next step in the process consists of converting ammonium to nitrite and then nitrate this two-step process is usually lumped into one term nitrification this step is facilitated by a specialized autotrophic bacteria so what does autotrophic mean there are two broad categories for how organisms obtained carbon required for growth autotrophs and heterotrophs autotrophs are able to obtain their carbon from non-organic sources such as carbon dioxide and the alkaline bicarbonate plants are good examples of how this is done heterotrophs on the other hand require organic sources of carbon essentially heterotrophs get carbon by consuming other organic compounds humans and animals being good examples in contrast to heterotrophic be OD consuming bacteria autotrophic nitrifiers require more time to mature and maintain their population in a biological wastewater treatment system the nitrifiers dictate the srt in nitrogen reducing plants how fast nitrifiers growth depends on the temperature of the wastewater and the amount of dissolved oxygen present if nitrifiers aren't allowed enough time to thrive you run the risk of accidentally wasting them out of the system entirely and losing nitrification higher temperatures and do concentrations means faster growth colder temperatures and lower do concentrations means slower growth also when no do is present nitrifiers can become completely inactive as a note it is important to remember that nitrifiers are also quite sensitive to pH pinning the function most comfortably in water with the pH between six point eight and seven point five once the healthy population of nitrifiers has developed in your system the first step performed largely by a group of bugs known as ammonia oxidizers will take the ammonium and do and convert it into acid water nitrite and energy if your system doesn't have adequate alkalinity the acid produced here could create in hospitably acidic conditions for the bacteria resulting in major process hiccups including loss of nitrification the water produced is absorbed in the system the nitrate moves on to the next step and the energy is used by the bacteria to grow and multiply the second step for which a group of bugs known as nitrite oxidizers is largely responsible takes that nitrite and mordio and converts it into nitrate and energy this conversion from ammonia to nitrate is nitrification typically full nitrification is observed when ammonia concentrations are reduced to less than two milligrams per liter and nitride concentrations to less than half a milligram per liter as mentioned nitrification is a very oxygen hungry process as a comparison in order to remove one pound of bo d 1.2 pounds of oxygen are required however to reduce one-pound of ammonia to nitrate 4.6 pounds of oxygen are required since getting dissolved oxygen into wastewater is a very energy intensive process it would benefit every treatment plants electrical bill if they didn't aerate more than they needed to over aerating does nothing to improve the process it really is flushing money down the toilet after nitrification the nitrogen is still in the system mostly as part of the bugs and in the form of nitrate though not as toxic as ammonia nitrates can still contribute to eutrophication and if released into a source supplying drinking water can endanger human populations specifically infants causing what is known as blue baby syndrome by interfering with blood oxygenation the final step in completely removing nitrogen from the system is called denitrification since nitrification is converting ammonia to nitrate one could think that denitrification is simply the reversal of this process confusingly yet fortunately this is not the case denitrification is performed by a specialized heterotrophic bacteria these guys require some pretty specific conditions to perform this step first of all they need some food or Bo D in order to oxidize that food they need oxygen their easiest and first choice for oxygen is do if there is no deal present however they look to alternative sources such as nitrate these specialists have the ability to strip the oxygen from nitrate molecules to satisfy their needs this critical environment where do is not present yet nitrates are is referred to as anoxic and is absolutely required for denitrification these bugs take the Bo D and nitrate to produce energy base and nitrogen gas the base is actually very useful in buffering the acid produced during nitrification the nitrogen gas then floats in tiny bubbles to the surface and into the atmosphere though great in the biological Basin denitrification in a clarifier can result in undesirable floating sludge there are many alternative strategies for developing anoxic conditions some treatment plants are designed to have dedicated anoxic zone volumes in the flow chart while others strive to develop these anoxic zones within the oxidation ditch or aeration zone by rigidly controlling iteration or by turning off aerators for set periods of time additionally under certain conditions micro anoxic zones can be developed within the bacterial flocks themselves resulting in what is referred to as simultaneous nitrification denitrification various levels of denitrification may be required depending on the local discharge permit however full biological denitrification typically results in only one to three milligrams of nitrate in the effluent stream to meet increasingly stringent standards the clean water is often put through a further filtration process sometimes shallow gravel beds are used to filter out any fine particles alternatively beds of reeds can also be used to give a final polish to the cleaned water before it's returned to the environment this method is particularly useful in rural locations to improve the water quality further the effluent is filtered through gravel filters sometimes referred to as deep sand filters once these filters are full of solids they're back washed and the washings go to the inlet of the works the treated effluent is now suitable for discharge to a river water quality is constantly measured using remote automatic sensors and double-checked periodically by technicians the final output from this works is well inside the statutory requirements the works can fully treat three times dry weather flow if the incoming flow is greater then after passing through the grit extractor the excess cascades over this we're into the channel on the left and flows into storm tanks here just under fourteen and a half thousand cubic meters of sewage can be stored and treated later this is the equivalent to three times dry weather flow for two hours in the unlikely event that the flow to the works is greater than six times the dry weather flow the storm tanks are designed to overflow and discharge direct to the river only an exceptionally heavy rainfall with this occur typically about twelve to fifteen times a year this isn't as bad as it sounds firstly the effluent is highly diluted with rain and secondly the river will be in spate and hence further dilution of the effluent takes place thus minimizing its impact on the environment so let's recap wastewater leaves your house gets treated at the wastewater treatment plant and returns here the same place your drinking water comes from why it's important to pay attention to what you put down sinks toilets and sewers number two and teepee that's it that's all that goes down there oh and teepee it means toilet paper oh yeah and this soap and water that's it the purpose of a wastewater treatment to remove all solids and pathogens you know microorganisms like bacteria and stuff is to accelerate nature specifically to develop specific conditions to grow some special bugs so what are these bugs all of the bugs being grown in the wastewater treatment plant are natural and perform the same tasks albeit in a little less dense populations in water and soil around the world the vast majority consists of various populations of bacteria to perform the bulk of the wastewater treatment process such as VOD removal nitrification denitrification phosphorus uptake and so on generally these bacteria are pretty boring to look at under the microscope but not all the bugs are boring looking at a sample under the microscope will in fact reveal some other more exciting guys they don't really contribute much to the overall process but can play an important role in process control so who are these guys let me make a note here that some of these guys will vary from process to process so you'll have to get to know your own population let's take a look at a family called stock ciliates first here we have a couple varieties that we're gonna talk about first is bored of selling these guys attached onto a flock of bacteria and have a retractable tail they can be pretty quick then there's Epis stylus similar before does sell Epis tieless also uses his tail to latch on to bacterial flock formations however this guy's a little bit more passive and does not have the retractable feature so he doesn't move around as much now to the family of the free-swimming ciliates these guys also come in a few different varieties here's NASPA Disko these little critters are easily identified by their mini crawling likes say hello to light on itis i don't know if i pronounced that correctly and here is trickled filament look at this guy go ah yes and rotifers these are a higher life form with cool hairy mammals and are much larger than many of the other bugs we see here some forms are much more mobile and move around constantly others a little bit less active on our worm friends the nematodes these tiny worms who can be active or just swimming lazily around the neighborhood can also be an indicator of some certain conditions both nematodes and rotifers can be indicative of an older bacterial biomass and in wastewater are indicative of a higher degree of purification or seeding from an attached growth system another important bacteria to note are called filamentous bacteria these include micro tricks parvis Ella nocardia theöthe ryx and a whole bunch of other characters with no names but are classified as type like length length length like type zero nine one four as you would expect filaments can also be used to identify conditions of sludge there is a whole suite of indicator tests available to identify which kind of present in your sludge so do we care who's in our process and how many of them there are great question the answer is yes here's why researchers in England several years ago evaluate the presence of ciliated organisms and treatment plants what they did was compare the effluent quality to the organisms that were present and they developed cable which correlated which organisms were present based upon what the effluent quality was like by identifying the filaments and by quantifying and tracking their presence one can use that information to understand and identify the potential effluent quality you would see for example vorticella and Epis tieless are seen normally with high quality effluent swear as a peculiar is seen more often in a lower quality effluent this English study was updated to reflect the condition for nitrification in a wastewater treatment plant and what they did was compare what particular ciliated organisms were present when nitrification was occurring and what organisms were present when it was no longer nitrifying in this second study a table was prepared and it showed the abundance of organisms that are more likely to reflect nitrifying conditions versus those that are present when might non nitrifying conditions accrue in all of these studies it was stressed by the researchers and should be understood by anyone using this identification technique that the relative abundance will probably change based upon the specific operating conditions and the wastewater stream characteristics for each and every wastewater treatment plant as such the tables provide a good starting point but should only be used as a starting point and if one wants to be certain what's going on they develop the table for their own facility using these studies one can see that when you see critters such as Florida sella when you see the shelled amoebas when you see some types of rotifers you see those only when there is low Bo D present in the waste it's not always the case but it's usually an indication that those conditions are present the best solution for any wastewater treatment plan is to do their own analysis prepare their own table and if you do that you'll be able to use the stock ciliates the rotifers and the amoebas to indicate what is happening and possibly predict the future of what it's going to change as previously touched upon filming tracking can be another powerful tool to monitor conditions in a wastewater treatment plant the abundance and type of filaments present can indicate various process conditions such as low dissolved oxygen low f2m ratio sept isset e excessive grease and oil nutrient deficiency and low pH checking filaments requires the use of staining tests tests for sulfur granules cell size and presence of septa as well as identification of attached growth on the filament Jenkins Richards and diagur developed the chart to use in the evaluation process with sufficient testing the exact filament can be identified the dominance of a filament indicates the operating conditions if you want to change the biomass change the underlying condition which supports that filament for example type 1701 indicates a low do wear type of 1851 indicates a low f2m ratio so what physical parameters could very well correlate with your microorganism populations well the following list is a good beginning spi and settling rates temperature bodt SS and nutrient removal rates dissolved oxygen levels f2m ratios wasting rates and sr t mix liquor concentration pH and the presence of pollutants once you identify and track indicator organisms you can change the conditions you have control over such as the mixed liquor concentration aeration Braslow pH adjustments and nutrient deficiencies this is Becton sewage works in East London the largest sewage plant in Europe over 300 acres fenced off from curious eyes a sheer scale only comprehensible from the air this one plant has to deal with the sewage and waste of all of North London over three and a half million people producing more than 12 million gallons of waste every hour these bubbling tanks of raw effluent are being slowly purified through a complex series of tanks and filters and after this water is so clear it can be pumped straight out into the Thames this is Becton sewage treatment works in the east of London and it's Europe's biggest it was originally part of Joseph Bazalgette scheme in the 19th century sewage was simply stored here in tanks then pumped out to the river at high tide so you'll be pleased to know today's process is a lot more refined and takes just four hours for raw sewage to be clean enough to return to the river every day this treatment works handles the sewage from 3.4 million Londoners and that's an astonishing volume it equates to 34 Olympic swimming pools every hour the first process happens here at the inlet works using these screens large lumps like bricks wood rags a raked out once collected these large objects will all be washed and sent to a landfill sites nearby they've even had half a car here meanwhile the remaining sewage passes on to the next part of the process into these primary settlement tanks now very basically it enters at that end and flows relatively slowly this way over the top of each tank is a moving bridge which has two blades to remove a solid organic material from the sewage the top blade skims scum from the surface while a second submerged blade dredges the heavier settled sludge from the bottom of the tank all this solid sludge is then sent for further processing the remaining sewage then flows down this way towards the secondary biological treatment process and here it is in these tanks the sewage is mixed in with billions upon billions of bacteria so all the dissolved materials that still remain can be by degraded and pumping air from below at very high pressures causes the sewage to be saturated with dissolved oxygen and this accelerates the biological breakdown is brilliant finally the treated effluent is tested to ensure it's clean enough to go back into the Thames remember all of the solids which was skimmed off earlier they're taken to a processing plant these sludges are bought to this filter press where it's the waters and the resulting sludge cake is incinerated and that provides 75% of this entire works power needs bio solids are the nutrient-rich byproduct of modern municipal wastewater treatment since the 1980s the management of these organic solids has been increasingly focused on recycling efforts to control pollution at its source have dramatically improved the quality of wastewater coming in to treatment plant and the quality bio solids now produced by these plants the sludge from the primary and secondary settling tanks is thickened in a picket fence thickener then centrifuged and finally line is added to stabilize it sewage sludge can be anaerobically digested to produce a combustible gas buried in landfill sites composted or incinerated but most of its transported to farms for use as a soil conditioner in our main wastewater treatment process we took the contaminants out of the waste water and concentrated them in the sludge now we've got to treat the sludge in order to make it less toxic to destroy the pathogens and have less of an impact on the environment we also want to make it where it's easier to handle and the processes that we're gonna look at they include thickening digestion and dewatering these processes will take the sludge recover some of the energy from it that we can use to power our wastewater treatment plant and also turn out a beneficial product that can be used for soil conditioning this is the sludge thickening process it's the first step and the solids handling processes and it's very similar to clarifiers that we looked at before where we slow the water down and allow the solids to settle out but the special feature of thickening is that we're taking our solids concentrations from about a half a percent all the way up to six percent solids the freezin we do that is so that we have less energy to pump the solids and so that we have a better treatment and the remainder of the solids handling processes in the gravity thick nor we use gravity to settle the sludge out and make it thicker so is easier to treat and the rest of the solids handling facilities in this facility it's a dissolved air flotation thickener or adapt and in it we take and dissolve air in the sludge under pressure then we release that pressure and the sludge floats to the top we end up with about a five percent solids blanket on the top which we scrape off and send to our solids handling facilities for digestion we're in the pump gallery for the sludge digesters we thicken the sludge in the sludge thickeners and we send it over here to the digesters in the digesters we heat the sludge up and the microorganisms start to break it down get rid of some of the volatile compounds make it to where it won't degrade any further in that process it also destroys some of the pathogens when we're finished the sludge is turned into a useful product but during that process we also generate some methane that methane gas we can use to run generators and those generators power part of our wastewater treatment plant they also generate waste heat which we use to heat up the digestion process so it's a nice circle we use a whole lot of the energy that's stored inside that sludge to make our process cheaper to operate you this is the digested sludge after we've used microorganisms and heat to destroy the pathogens and reduce the material that might degrade further and cause odour problems but there's still a lot of water left in this sludge so we're gonna have to do some dewatering process to get rid of the water make it easier to handle cheaper to transport and so that we can land apply it as a soil conditioner the use of bio solids has come under considerable public and regulatory scrutiny regulations for wastewater solids highly protective of human health and the environment in 2009 wastewater sludge production in UK amounted to around 1.2 millions a dry solids of which 77 percent was recycled to agricultural land and for EU as a whole there are about 6.5 megatons of dry solids produced annually in the next decade sludge disposal to all the established outlets could become increasingly difficult the challenges faced have been how to maintain cost-effective and secure methods of sludge disposal and engender public confidence in all disposal and recycling options of increased importance is a potential of renewable energy from the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge sludge treatment and disposal may account for 40% of the operating cost of a wastewater treatment facility treatment process begins with the separation of sewage into solid and liquid material the solid waste or sludge is broken down by bacteria in digestion tanks one of the byproducts of sludge digestion is biogas containing a high proportion of methane in the past at most sites the gas had only been used to fuel a hot water boiler which then heated the digestion tanks but this far more gas produced than is actually needed for heating the only way of disposing of the excess gas was to burn it off using a flare stack environmentally that's not a great solution by far the best option is to take all of the potential energy and methane gas produced by the digestion process and use it in a combined heat and power plant here methane gas from the digestion process is used to fuel modern highly efficient engines driving alternators to produce electricity at the same time heat produced by the engines is transferred by a hot water system to the digestion tanks it's a very efficient and self fueling process and the fuel is free the remaining sludge can then be used as a fertilizer on local farms by rethinking how we manage and use our water we can begin to solve many of the problems we've all learned about reducing reusing and recycling our trash we need to learn to apply these 3 R's to all of our resources especially water the water supply guys use the term integrated water management but like we said they're only concerned with water supply and not the big picture true integrated water management needs holistic reform that integrates multiple agencies and members of the public and solves multiple problems beyond just meeting our ever-increasing water demands if we take a closer look at how we use water at home there are many opportunities to conserve and minimize our own water footprint first of all we can reduce our water consumption with low-flow showerheads laden clothes washers and other smart appliances although our sewer systems are designed to process human waste we put many other things down our sewer lines like kitchen scraps cleaners drugs and other chemicals which can get into our rivers and ocean harming fish and other aquatic life we should think before we use our drains for waste disposal in many homes more than half the water used goes to maintain a big green lawn wasting water that we could drink or leave in place for fish and other wildlife plants adapted to our region's climate and soil require a lot less water and maintenance replacing a part of our lawn with native plants can save up to half of our household water use an ocean friendly garden conserves water and reduces polluted runoff helping to reduce flooding and keep pollution out of our creeks and coastal waters while giving you a beautiful garden full of new wildlife a really fun alternative to boring grass by contouring the land adding dry creeks or seasonal ponds and using permeable solutions for our walkways and driveways runoff can soak into the soil to recharge local aquifers we can also capture rain from our gutter with a simple rain barrel and keep it for reuse later much of the water that we used inside our homes can also be reused on our Gardens called great water this is slowly being accepted as a great way to reuse the water from your clothes washer or bathtub to water the plants in your garden reusing our slightly used water in this way not only helps reduce our water demand but it also reduces the amount of water we send to the wastewater treatment plant every day these basic ideas can be applied on a larger scale within our neighborhood or our entire city think of the benefits read by entire neighborhoods that reduce water use capture rainwater and eliminate water pollution we can redesign our communities to capture rain close to the source to filter back into the ground like the natural water cycle or to store it for reuse during dry times the streets in our neighborhood can be landscaped with contoured ditches known as bioswales these capture Street runoff so trees and plants can use and filter the water where space is limited large underground cisterns can collect storm water for later use pervious pavement can filter rainwater through parking lots reducing runoff known as low-impact development it's rapidly catching up knowing that development can transform the landscape from one that sheds water causing flooding and water pollution back to a more natural state that captures and absorbs water many treatment plants can generate energy from solid waste and new technologies may make it possible to generate enough to operate the plant as well as provide a local source of biofuel if we rethink how we transport and process wastewater new opportunities arise many cities are now reclaiming waste water that's right sewage for reuse in our homes and businesses or for direct recharge of aquifers one of the best opportunities for waste water is recycling it to drinking standards potable reuse is the process of purifying our wastewater to make it drinkable waste water from homes and businesses is forced to very fine filters allowing water molecules through while trapping dissolved salts and other impurities potable reuse is an efficient source of water because it makes use of water that is already in our local water system and it is also good for the environment because it takes impurities out of the system eliminating the need to discharge polluted wastewater into the ocean communities around the country are already drinking it as part of their normal water supply turning raw sewage into drinking water doesn't sound terribly appetizing but that's what's happening in Orange County in Southern California Orange County faces chronic water shortages to meet the needs of its growing population the county spent five hundred million dollars on a state-of-the-art water treatment plant it's the first of its kind in the United States there's few new sources of water and this is going to be one that's going to be key environmentally friendly cost competitive and if recycles the facility treats the sewage with advanced filtration technique such as reverse osmosis where high-pressure sends water molecules through ultrafine membranes ultraviolet light is also used to remove contaminants but the biggest challenges are not technological one of the problems these type of projects has to overcome is separating the toilet from the tap the process is state-of-the-art technology but unless the people are willing to accept the water all the engineering goes for not it's the idea of drinking water from a toilet that's not easy for everyone to swallow to win over the public the plant opens its doors daily for tours visits which end of course with a tasting session this is a basically an example to the world on how you can recycle sewage we have to do this I mean it's we're running out of water we've got to do this for the time being the water is pumped into underground aquifers where it will stay for several months before joining the drinking waters now is the time for a water management system that integrates the 3 R's reduce reuse recycle to address our water crisis and help reverse the damage caused by our current mismanaged system this truly integrated water management program creates a holistic solution that incorporates ocean friendly gardens and low-impact development to reduce our impact on the water supply ray water systems encourage the reuse of our precious water resources and potable reuse recycles the water we've already paid for and transported we have the unique opportunity to transform water management and meet our current and future needs with science and technology that is proven to work residents businesses and government agencies must all work together to seize this opportunity and chanter water happiness before it's too late you./elitetoggle",

Wastewater sources and their characteristics Pathways of domestic wastewater Household sanitation management infrastructures Realistic holistic sanitation systems\r\n\n4 Tasks of sanitation systems\r\nPrevent disease - guarantee effective barriers against sanitation related diseases Protect the environment - prevent pollution, return nutrients to the soil, and conserve water. Be simple - operation of the system must be feasible using locally available resources (human and material). Where technical skills are limited, simple technologies should be preferred. Be affordable - total costs (incl. capital, operation, maintenance costs) must be within the users' ability to pay. Be culturally acceptable - it should fit local customs, beliefs, and desires. Work for everyone - it should address the needs of children and adults, of women and men. The first question of course is: Why do we need any sanitation facility, be it a latrine, a flush toilet, a septic tank or whatever? What conditions must be fulfilled by any sanitation system? Sanitation system must...\r\n\n5 What are we talking about?\r\nBlackwater toilet wastewater (faeces and urine with or without flushing water) Greywater domestic wastewater form kitchen, bath, shower (excluding faeces and urine) Brownwater Blackwater without urine Yellowwater Urine Domestic wastewater consists of different fractions, with very specific characteristics Faecal sludge Sludge accumulating in \"on-site sanitation systems\" (Latrines, Septic tanks, etc.)\r\n\n6 The Path of Excreta and Greywater in Urban Areas\r\nThe human waste system The Path of Excreta and Greywater in Urban Areas ~ 2 billion (2004) ~ 3 billion (2025) sewered sanitation (black and greywater) \"on-site\" sanitation (excreta, black and greywater) Latrines (trad., VIP, PF, double-pit, no-mix, ...) Greywater Septic tanks Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Small-bore sewerage for effluent of interceptor or septic tanks Effluent to soakage or drains Septage FS treatment Plant (FSTP) Liquid to discharge into receiving waters or to co-treatment in WWTP \"Faecal sludge-FS\" Products from double-pit and no-mix latrines might be used on-site Effluent to agricultural use or discharged into receiving waters Biosolids to agriculture for soil conditioning and fertilization Eawag / Sandec 2004\r\n\n7 Characteristics of the different wastewater sources\r\nTotal Greywater Urine Faeces Volume [l/capa] 25' '000 25' '000 500 50 Nutrients Nitrogen 2-4 kg/capa 5% 85% 10% Phosphorous kg/capa 10%* 60% 30% Potassium kg/capa 34% 54% 12% COD 30kg/capa 41% 47% Faecal coliforms - /100ml 0* /100ml Main differences are in terms of quantities, nutrient content, and level of pathogenic contamination: Urine: Contains almost all the nitrogen and large parts of the potassium and phosphorous excreted by humans. N:P:K = 10:1:2 Urine is usually sterile (exceptions known by urinary tract infections). Contamination with pathogens occurs only if urine is exposed to faeces. Easily applicable, diluted or not, depending on the crop and crop stage. Faeces: Mainly undigested organic matter made up of carbon. Faeces contain almost all pathogens: bacteria (e.g. faecal coliforms, vibro cholerae) viruses (e.g. rota virus) protozoa (e.g. amoeba hystolitica) helminths (e.g. Ascaris eggs) Low nutrient content, but good characteristics as soil conditioner: increase the organic matter content, improve the water holding capacity. Greywater: Greywater is defined as household wastewater without input of human excreta It includes used water from baths, showers, hand basins, washing machines, dishwashers, laundries and kitchen sinks Big quantities with relatively low nutrient contents. Big reuse potential: Irrigation: Agriculture, landscape, aquaculture Municipal uses: Fire protection, street cleaning, car washing, cooling, road construction operation, ... Non-potable domestic uses: Toilet flushing, laundry, floor cleaning Main issue: Toxic substances (organic compounds, metals, chlorine etc.), fats from kitchen, can affect natural treatment and disposal systems → source control very important component of greywater management system * healthy people ** can be as high as 50%, depending on washing and dish-washing powder used\r\n\n8 Of course there are many more aspects!\r\nCriteria influencing the selection of sanitation systems Economic, institutional and other aspects regulations and standards (including enforcement) costs for construction, O&M willingness to pay (initial and monthly payments) self-help potential and initiative of local people and organizations local entrepreneurs, consultants, construction companies, ... Existing system! .... Of course there are many more aspects! comprehensive list doesn't exist strongly depends on local settings list of criteria has to be developed on-spot, in close collaboration with local people,organisations and institutions\r\n\n9 Classification of Excreta and wastewater management technologies\r\nCesspit trucks That means that we have a whole series of sanitation concepts (all with certain strengths and limitations) which require a whole series of technological modules. Decentralised and centralised options In DC, also in urban areas, most common systems are decentralised systems. Of course historically grown, but as explained by Roland yesterday, decentralised sanitation not only because centralised systems not affordable, has its advantages:\r\n\n10 Partially sewered cities\r\nBusiness centre of large cities with high water consumption rate Lack of treatment sites and wastewater treatment plants Discharge of wastewater into natural water bodies and open canals\r\n\n11 Cities without sewers Represent more than 90% of cities in developing countries Are very heterogeneous in urban infrastructure Often lack financial and human resources for sanitation development and upgrading\r\n\n12 Decentralised sanitation systems are often more suitable - why?\r\nExisting systems are decentralised (e.g. latrines) Treatment and reuse can be tailored to the specific waste stream (e.g. urine, faeces, greywater etc.) Decentralised systems are easier to plan and implement (different \"independent\" areas with specific needs and characteristics) Capital investments are generally less than for centralised systems (reduced investments for trunk sewers and pumping stations, lower O&M costs) Capacity expansion and thus capital requirements can track demand much more closely (incremental approach) No reason to impose a \"one size fits all\" approach Different strategies can be employed in various parts of the service area.\r\n\n13 The Path of Excreta and Greywater in Urban Areas\r\nThe human waste system The Path of Excreta and Greywater in Urban Areas ~ 2 billion (2004) ~ 3 billion (2025) sewered sanitation (black and greywater) \"on-site\" sanitation (excreta, black and greywater) Latrines (trad., VIP, PF, double-pit, no-mix, ...) Greywater Septic tanks Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Small-bore sewerage for effluent of interceptor or septic tanks Effluent to soakage or drains Septage FS treatment Plant (FSTP) Liquid to discharge into receiving waters or to co-treatment in WWTP \"Faecal sludge-FS\" Products from double-pit and no-mix latrines might be used on-site Effluent to agricultural use or discharged into receiving waters Biosolids to agriculture for soil conditioning and fertilization Eawag / Sandec 2004\r\n\n14 On-site dry systems Simple pit latrine\r\n2 m or more in depth covered by latrine slab with or without superstructure percolation of liquids into soil partial anaerobic decomposition of solids + cheap, easily understood - unstable soils (→ lining) - not good with high water table - hazardous and difficult emptying (depth  2 m) - odor problems, fly breathing Let's come back to normal situations in urban and peri-urban areas. Quite theoretical material, cannot go too much into detail, many source books.

Toilet paper separation: Toilet paper will not decompose in the chamber (only dehydration process) → separate collection in a bucket. If the toilets are well operated and maintained, no smell problems will occur. Vent pipe and window ensure a sufficient aeration\r\n\n30 Urine diversion latrines\r\nProcessing chambers: Always 2 chambers Above ground level, sealed Access to the chambers should be possible from outside the house Volume according to accumulation rate and number of users; → guide value: l/year/user and chamber\r\n\n31 Emptying urine divertion toilet\r\n\n32 Household / neighbourhood treatment systems\r\nSeptic tank most frequent on-site treatment unit worldwide sedimentation tank settled sludge partially stabilised by anaerobic digestion 1-3 compartments Almost no removal of dissolved and suspended matter + simple, little space required (underground) + high institutional acceptance - low treatment efficiency (COD removal approx. 50%) - O&M often neglected (desludging) or unkown!! → look for national design standards!\r\n\n33 Septic tank design V=V1 + V2 + V3 V3=F*h\r\nV3: scum layer F: surface of the tank h: height of the scum layer h=20-30cm V1 and V3 can also be estimated based on existing figures:\r\n\n34 Household / neighbourhood treatment systems\r\nAnaerobic baffled reactor (baffled septic tank) Improved septic tank 2 to 3 chambers in series (up to 5) Intensive contact between resident sludge and fresh influent Treatment efficiency: 65 to 90% COD removal HRT = 2-3 days + simple, high treatment efficiency, hardly any blockages + high removal efficiencies, also for suspended and dissolved solids - construction and maintenance more complicated than conventional septic tank\r\n\n35 Septic systems\r\n\n36 Household / neighbourhood treatment systems\r\nAnaerobic filter Used for pre-settled domestic wastewater with low SS concentrations (e.g. greywater) Principle: close contact of wastewater with active bacterial mass on filter media filter material surface: 90 to 300m2 per m3 Treatment efficiency: 70 to 90% COD removal Volume: m3/cap for domestic wastewater + simple and durable if well constructed and wastewater properly pre-treated; high treatment efficiency; little space requirements - high construction costs (filter media); blockage of filter possible - maintenance costly and difficult\r\n\n37 Faecal sludge - underestimated problem\r\n2-2.5 billion urban dwellers on on-site sanitation !

Premier of the Western Cape, Helen Zille, was set to meet with the National Disaster Management team yesterday and she's also reported to have written a letter to president Jacob Zuma, asking him to declare the water situation a national disaster. She joins us now from our SeaPoint studio.\r\n\r\nWater crisis in Cape Town as 'day zero' approaches\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tX148enY\r\n\r\nGuardian News - Published on Feb 3, 2018\r\nAfter years of severe drought, Cape Town officials are preparing to shut off mains water supplies to a million homes. Residents have also been asked to limit their use to 50 litres a day as 'day zero' approaches\r\n\r\nIs Cape Town facing a future without water?\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgVbPeEeDy4\r\n\r\nAl Jazeera English - Streamed live on Dec 20, 2017\r\nMay 18, 2018 is being called \"Day Zero\" in South Africa. By that day, the country's second largest city is projected to be without water and its dams at catastrophic levels. So how did Cape Town reach this point?\r\n\r\nSouth Africa is experiencing a major drought. 2017 was the driest year in decades, and the third successive year of poor rainfall. Dams have gone unreplenished, underground aquifers are tapped out, springs and boreholes are running dry. Calls by the mayor's office to the city's more than 4 million residents to cut water use to less than 87 litres per person have gone unheeded. Fines have been flouted. And water has already been shut down for several hours a day in areas outside the city center.\r\n\r\nClimatologists have pointed to climate change as a possible factor. And future projections show a shift towards a drier climate. Some activists even say the water crisis is political. They blame poor cooperation and coordination between the African National Congress ruling party, and the local and provincial government of the Western Cape run by the Democratic Alliance. Western Cape government officials say appeals to declare the province a disaster zone went unheeded by the ANC for months.\r\n\r\nBut a recent report by the South African Water Caucus found financial mismanagement and corruption in the local Department of Water and Sanitation, and that the city responded to warning signals too late. \r\n\r\nOn Wednesday we'll take a look at the debate around the root of the crisis, and how Cape Town is planning for the near future. Join us at 1930GMT.\r\n\r\nCape Town Crisis Worsens, Water Rationing Put In Place\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoOZWNKQJo\r\n\r\nNDTV - Published on Feb 2, 2018\r\nWater crisis continues to grip Cape Town, which is set to become the first major world metropolitan to run out of water if stringent water measures that have been put in place from today at only 50 litres of water per person per day come into effect. The city is desperate to avoid what is called day zero, or the day taps will run dry and 4 million people will have to stand in lines to get just 25 litres of water per person per day.\r\n\r\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

But, at Southwest Airlines, our Maintenance and Engineering Team might just think about aircraft water system disinfection first when thinking about oxygen.  We use a unique process using ozone gas to disinfect our onboard water system.  This process uses electricity to create ozone that disinfects the entire water system before safely reverting back to oxygen.\r\n\nThe idea to purify Southwest's water systems through ozonation came from an unlikely place -- a California winery.  The ozone disinfection process is one that large-scale wine makers have been using for years, but had not been used within the airline industry.  What's exciting about this process is that ozone quickly dissipates from the water and eliminates the need for flushing chlorine, or other chemicals, out of our water systems.  The use of ozone also significantly reduces the time it takes to complete the disinfection process from several hours to less than one hour. After lots of research and proprietary Southwest Engineering design work, we were able to convert a reliable ozonation unit into an effective Southwest tool to keep our water system clean.     \r\n\nWe hope you'll enjoy this video where you'll get a behind-the-scenes look at our unique water quality process!",

There are different types of IWTP models in terms of hydraulic and process performance. Today, the application of MBR system in wastewater treatment process as an output filter for effluent is of primary importance.  This model is a small scale form of an urban wastewater treatment plant using extended aeration and MBR system. Operational details and utilities are employed inside it.\r\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCvJddSdnF4\r\n\nThe term 'membrane bioreactor' (MBR) is generally used to define wastewater treatment processes where a perm-selective membrane eg microfiltration or ultrafiltration is integrated with a biological process - a suspended growth bioreactor. MBRs differ from 'polishing' processes where the membrane is employed as a discrete tertiary treatment step with no return of the active biomass to the biological process. - http://www.thembrsite.com/about-mbrs/what-are-mbrs/",

It can be used where grid electrification is not available and also to supplement it. It generates enough power to provide adequate lighting, entertainment and also can power a fridge or a freezer (View the brochure). The initial system supplied consists of three interior lights that can be used for eight hours a night, one exterior security light, a 75W panel, a 102AH battery, stainless steel battery box all necessary cable and a solar panel roof- or floor-mount bracket. A DC plug box is supplied that accommodates a 12V radio, a 12V DSTV system and the 12V colour LED television. Although this system is only supplied with a 75W prime crystalline panel it has the potential to have 200W of solar panels connected to it. The standard unit is supplied with a radio. The growth of the system can accommodate a television, Hi-Fi, DSTV, DVD and eventually a fridge or freezer that is supplied by Specialized Solar Systems(SSS) as a 'top up' option. The SS20 Smart Box also has the ability to be programmed according to ambient temperature to ensure the correct rate of charge is adhered to. The programmable smart box also has a voltage protection setting ensuring that the usable cycle of the battery is well maintained. The design is tamper proof with seals in the battery box and in the load output of the smart box. The fusing systems design functions not only as a current limiter , but also offers the necessary protection against short circuits. The unit is modular and expandable. It can be adapted according to the consumers needs and has the \"top up\" potential to accommodate a fridge or freezer. For further info please visit www.specializedsolarsystems.co.za/div",

Adobe consists of clay, sand, silt, water, and a fibrous binding material such as finely chopped straw. After the components are mixed, adobe is either moulded into bricks or hand manipulated into courses, and then left to dry in the sun. \n\n Adobe history:\nAdobe architecture was used widely in ancient civilizations from what's now known as Southwest America down to Peru. The word adobe, though, came from Spanish. Adobe construction, also known as mudbrick construction, is a very ancient method of building and can be found essentially in any ancient or modern civilizations where the climate is mostly hot and dry. [1]\n\nWhy use adobe:\nAdobe is a sustainable and low-cost material that can be used in a variety of ways. Adobe has a high thermal capacity and low thermal conductivity[2], making it an ideal material for hot and dry climates that quickly become cold at night. Adobe walls passively heat and cool the interior of buildings by storing up heat throughout the day and releasing it into the interior at night. Passive heating and cooling is much more sustainable and energy efficient than modern HVAC systems which make up 6% of all electricity consumtion in the United States alone [3].\nHowever, adobe, specifically unbaked adobe, would not be ideal for wet climates since they will eventually dissolve and erode away when rained on or exposed to moisture. There are methods for making adobe constructions last much longer, such as baking the bricks, but is still a more ideal material for airid climates.\n\n Citations:\n[1] Britannica, T.

The soil is roughly composed of sand and clay. Cob is an easy and fast-drying material that is most often used for the construction of Cob Houses. Cob, once dry, is usually coated with a plaster in order to seal it from the elements and give it an appearance unique to the builder's choosing. Cob is incredibly moldable and makes for extremely customizable structures, therefore people who use it to build homes often create unique and fantastical designs. Almost anyone can build cob houses, as long as one has the right tools, a detailed plan, and friends to help in the process.\n\nWhy use cob:\nCob is sustainable and cheap since it can be sourced from the build site itself and because straw can be purchased for low prices from local farms or feed-and-tack stores. Cob is typically sealed with plaster, thus making it weatherproofed and suitable for most climates: though, in climates where some seasons can be cold and wet, it is best to limit construction of cob houses to summers where the weather is warm and dry. \nCob is a material with high thermal capacity, giving it excellent passive cooling/warming capabilities and insulating properties, therefore limiting energy consumption.\n\n How to make cob and build with it:\nHere is a simple guide to planning for and constructing cob houses.\n\n{{ rawhtml }}\n\niframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6i-SPzf4B9E\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen/iframe\n\n{{ /rawhtml }}\n",

The hemp stalks are mixed with lime and water or sometimes a different binding agent, and then compressed into bricks. \nHempcrete is not a new building material, in fact, its rather ancient, but it has gained new traction and popularity amongst sustainbale builders and construction companies. It is favored for its carbon-negative properties as a building material and the sustainability of hemp crop. \n\n Pros and Cons of Hempcrete:\nLike any building material, hempcrete has its benefits and its limitations. Unlike conventional portland concrete or other concretes and cements, hempcrete is carbon negative, which means it actually absorbs carbon out of the surrounding air and by doing so becomes stronger whereas conventional concrete emit CO2 emissions. Hempcrete is also nontoxic, excellent at insulating, regulates humindity, is  fire, pest, and mold resistant.\nThe downside of hemp is that it is not reliable for loadbearing walls during its curing process, and can take quite a while to cure when poured as a slurry into a wall form. This is combatted by hempcrete manufacturers by using bricks, which cure faster, or by using wooden forms in the wall along with the hempcrete. Once hempcrete is cured, though, it slowly petrifies and becomes very strong and can last for hundreds of years.\n\nSource:\nBurkey, D. (2016, March 30).

With mudbricks you can use them as insulation, or as walls themselves. Mudbricks have a high thermal mass, giving them good insulation capabilities that keep interiors cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. However, mudbricks do not have a long life span when left exposed to wind and rain. They will slowly dissolve in water and be eroded away. Mudbricks can be made stronger by firing them in a kiln.\n\n History of mud bricks:\nMudbricks date back to the pre-pottery neolitic era (10,000-8,800 BCE). They were used by many ancient cultures around the world, independently, creating slight variations in methods and uses, but are still commonly used in present day. Mudbrick may also be referred to as adobe. Adobe is a spanish word for mudbrick construction. Today, adobe refers more broadly to what's now considered the Adobe Style and less so the actual building methods. \nsource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudbrick\n\nHow to make mudbricks:\n{{ rawhtml }}\n\niframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XfcbtZcpWrA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen/iframe\n\n{{ /rawhtml }}\n",

The pressure switch monitors the pressure of water and turns the pump on or off.\nIf your pump is not running when it should be, you may have a faulty pressure switch. This could be for a number of reasons:\nNo water or not enough water is not reaching the pressure switch\nPressure switch is not wired or connected correctly\nPressure switch is damaged\n\nView this guide on troubleshooting pressure switch issues:\nhttps://empirepumpinc.com/well-inspections/well-pump-pressure-switch-problems/\n\nA damaged pressure switch can sometimes be repaired, but it is often cost-effective to replace it.\n\n Running pump dry / not priming\n\n Priming a water pump means to remove all the air from the system.  Water pumps need to be primed before use.\n Involves filling the pump system with water usually through a designated port called the prime plug or prime opening.\n This website explains the priming process in more detail: https://inspectapedia.com/water/PrimeTheWell_Pump.php\n\nVideo 1 shows an example of priming a pump.  NOTE: It is not recommended to prime pump while running\n\nMechanical seal issue\nIf your water pump is not leaking water, there may be a leak or other issue with the mechanical seal. Replacing a mechanical seal or gasket will be different for every pump, but follows the same basic process.  \n\n  Disconnect power and drain if required\n  Disassemble pump \n  Remove old seal\n  Clean and lubricate where necesarry\n  Replace seal or gasket and reassemble\n\nIt is best to consult the directions specific to your water pump.  This information can usually be found in the operations manual or on the manufacturers website.  \nSee this video for one example of a mechanical seal replacement:\n\niframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-fXzTTN0ME0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen/iframe\n\n \n Impeller damage\nIn centrifugal pumps, the impeller can be damaged, which will prevent the pump from moving water.  If the water pump feels slower, weaker or unable to pump at all, it may have a damaged impeller.  The easiest way to confirm if the impeller is damaged is to take the pump apart and look at it. \nMost impellers can be purchased and replaced. Consult the manufactures website or pump documentation to identify the correct impeller.  It is crucial to use the correct impeller, or the pump will not function correctly.\n\nSee this example video for replacing an impeller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI-zHbQ17uk&ab_channel=McLanahanCorporation\nNOTE: Not every pump will be exactly like the video, but the process is similar.  \n\nImproper wiring\nImproper or damaged wiring can also cause a pump to malfunction or stop working.  One way to investigate electrical issues is to test wires for power and resistance. \nWater pumps typically come in 2-wire and 3-wire configurations.  This guide explains the difference between 2-wire and 3-wire pumps and how they are wired: https://www.waterpumpsdirect.com/stories/1852-Well-Pump-Installation-Guide.html\n\nIf the insulation on the wiring is damaged, electricity will leak out.  To test for defective wires measure the resistance. Video 3 explains one method of testing the insulation of well pump wires.  \n\nThe measured resistance can mean different things, depending on what the value is:\nLow Resistance: Leak in insulation (usually a nick or cut somewhere along the wire)\nZero or Near Zero Resistance: A short in the circuit wiring\nInfinite or Very Large Resistance: Break in circuit\n\n Supplementary Videos\n\nVideo 1\n{{ rawhtml }}\n\niframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HTijuouVtoo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen/iframe\n\n{{ /rawhtml }}\n\n Video 2\n\n{{ rawhtml }}\n\niframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-fXzTTN0ME0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen/iframe\n\n{{ /rawhtml }}\n\nVideo 3\n\n{{ rawhtml }}\n\niframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YC2jptaU0qc?start=96\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen/iframe\n\n{{ /rawhtml }}\n\n",

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nWhy do we use it?\n\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n Where does it come from?\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.

The foundations are retrofitted to existing structures or designed with new structures. \n\n Why are buoyant foundations used and important?: \nBuoyant foundations are a sustainable and accessible solution for communities frequently, and with worsening intensity, impacted by seasonal flooding and/or rising sea levels. Buoyant foundations allow pre-existing strucutres to adapt to the worsening climate without suffering repetitive damage, risking illness due to water contamination, and causing families and communities to be displaced.\n\nThe Buoyant Foundation Project: \nThe Buoyant Foundation Project is a non-profit founded by Elizabeth English in 2006 as a solution for communities in New Orleans that were devastated by flooding caused by hurricain Katrina. The project expanded over the years to help more communities around the world facing similar issues such as in Vietnam, Jamaica, and Nicaragua. Elizabeth English's inspiration for the project came from the Netherlands where an amphibious community in a flood-prone region was being developed along the Maas river 2]. The developers in the Netherlands were using hollow concrete boxes for buoyancy in their architecture, but since that method is more costly and not as easily retrofitted to pre-existing and historic housing, English gathered a team, founding the [Buoyant Foundation Project and together developing a more inexpensive and simple solution for New Orleans [2].The solution English and her team came up with was relatively cheap and easily installed by at least two, non-expert, handy individuals without need for heavy machinery/equipment. The result was a metal frame fitted to the bottom of the original foundation of a home, held in place by four or more pillars in which the entire structure can rise and fall with the flood water height on a fixed vertical axis [2]. \n\n Citations: \n[1] The Buoyant Foundation Project. https://www.buoyantfoundation.org/home\n[2] Anthes, Emily.

The result is a solid and lightweight mass in the shape of the mould of one’s choosing. \n\nPros and Cons of mushroom bricks:\nAs an up-and-coming green building material, mushroom bricks have a lot of potential as a sustainable construction material -- for structural use, insulation, and even furniture. This is because they are made with the waste product of other industries, produce zero carbon waste, and are biodegradable. The other qualities it has is that it can trap more heat than conventional fiberglass insulation and it is stronger pound for pound than concrete [2]. This makes it a promising material for carbon neutral and carbon negative structures. \nBut, there are always disadvantages to any building material. For mushroom bricks the most major disadvantage is its lifespan: depending on the environmental conditions and substrate-mycelium combination, the material could last as little as 6 weeks to 20 years before decomposing [2]. The cause of such a short life span is due to overexposure to moisture and humidity, and/or unstable climate. Despite this, there are solutions one can use to avoid a too-short lifespan for their mushroom bricks such as keeping the bricks off of the ground and protected from the weather [2]. With their lifespan in mind, these bricks are best suited for places with more stable climates where it's not too wet and the seasons do not change drastically.\n\n How they're made:\nTo create mushroom bricks Takes time. The most common bricks are made up of oyster mushrooms and sawdust for bricks and insulation purposes. Once one has decided on a substrate-mycelium mixture, then the mold is next. Plastic moulds are best suited for this since they will require less washing [2]. It is best to avoid wooden moulds, and glass or metal ones can work, but will require more maintenance. The mould should be air tight with a lot of humidity on the inside and some holes for gas exchange [2]. It should also be kept in mind that the properties of the chosen mycelium and substrate will be more or less reflected in the finished product, therefore the mycelium and substrate should be chosen and tested for the desired purpose. \n\nCitations: \n[1] Arthur, Golda.
