Jitegemee United Support Trust(SHG)(JUST is in a rapid growth cycle for physically challenged people in Njiru and they needed a donation platform that had the ability to grow with them. When it comes to digital fundraising there are loads of competitors that talk a good game, but  Mr Goeg Wilson recommended  Qgiv. Then Qgiv stepped up and promise to  help make it happen. They promise us, that they will coach us, and given us the confidence to up our own game and improve our results.
We are happy here at JUST centre that we switched over to Qgiv. We can easily track donations, and having a dashboard that is updated as individual donations are made can prove to be very valuable. From the beginning Qgiv has worked hard at putting us first, and has been very responsive to our questions and demands. Thank you Mr Goeg Wilson for recomedation.

In Nairobi Njiru the JUST SHG fund will be used to support organizations of  PWD become aware and take full advantage of the mechanisms that enable their effective influence in decision-making and policy implementation processes at the local levels. 
An Act of Parliament to provide for the rights and rehabilitation of persons with disabilities; to achieve equalization of opportunities for persons with disabilities; to establish the National Council for Persons with Disabilities; and for connected purposes
ENACTED by the Parliament of Kenya as follows:‚Äî
1 Short title and commencement.
This Act may be cited as the Persons with Disabilities Act, 2003 and shall come into operation on such date as the Minister may, by notice in the Gazette, appoint and different dates may be appointed for different provisions.‚Äô‚Äô
2 Interpretation.
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires‚Äî
‚Äúadjustment order‚Äù means an order made by the Council under section 24;
‚Äúaged person‚Äù includes a person with a disability who has been forced into retirement from employment due to his disability;
‚Äúassistive devices and services‚Äù means implements, tools and specialized services (including the services of qualified interpreters for the deaf and qualified teachers for the blind) provided to persons with disabilities to assist them in education, employment or other activities;
‚ÄúCouncil‚Äù means the National Council for Persons with Disabilities established under section 3;
‚Äúdisability‚Äù means a physical, sensory, mental or other impairment, including any visual, hearing, learning or physical incapability, which impacts adversely on social, economic or environmental participation;
‚Äúdiscriminate‚Äù means to accord different treatment to different persons solely or mainly as a result of their disabilities and includes using words, gestures or caricatures that demean, scandalise or embarrass a person with a disability;
‚Äúdoctor‚Äù means a person registered or licensed as a medical practitioner under the
Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act;
‚ÄúFund‚Äù means the National Development Fund for Persons with Disabilities established under section 32;
‚Äúorganizations for persons with disabilities‚Äù means associations or societies formed for the purposes of rendering services to persons with disabilities;
‚Äúorganizations of persons with disabilities‚Äù means associations or societies formed by persons with disabilities for their welfare and protection;
‚Äúusual day-to-day activities‚Äù means the activities of daily living which an ordinary person would reasonably be expected to carry out.
The existing legal framework is conducive to participation of PWD in public life. The Law on 
Inclusion of and Accessibility for PwD (2003) and the Law on Public Consultation(2003)
create obligations for state agencies to conduct public consultations with PWD and their organizations during the adoption process of legislation and policies that affect 
them. In addition, the recently adopted National Action Plan on the Rights of PWD (2016-2020)

Thanks for your response,Njiru is good.Hujambo
The most common greeting among those who speak Swahili is 'Hujambo' ('Hello') or the more colloquial greeting of 'Jambo'. Both greetings can be responded with the phrase 'sijambo', which means 'I am well'. Other common greetings in contemporary Kenya include 'sasa' or 'Mambo'.

When Kenyans greet one another, they will often inquire about each other‚Äôs family and well-being.

The most typical gesture when greeting is a handshake. It is expected that one shakes the hands of everyone present. For example, if you enter a room with ten people, it is common that you would take the time to greet each by verbally greeting them and shaking their hand.

Supporting the right forearm with the left hand while shaking demonstrates respect for an elder or someone of higher social status. Verbal greetings are usually said before the handshake.

If two people are greeting and one of the person‚Äôs hands are not clean, they may politely choose to grasp the other‚Äôs arm at elbow level as opposed to their hand. This is done out of courtesy.

Men may greet other men with a handshake and a hug if they have a close friendship.

Between women, a handshake is appropriate in most social situations. However, good friends and family will often exchange a hug and a light kiss on the cheek.

When greeting a man, the polite form of address is ‚Äòbwana‚Äô (a combination of ‚Äòmister‚Äô and ‚Äòsir‚Äô).

For anybody around the age of forty and above, the term ‚Äòmzee‚Äô (‚Äòolder man‚Äô or ‚Äòelder‚Äô) is used. This term signifies respect for the person, their wisdom and experience as an elder.

For women of any age, the typical form of address is ‚Äòmama‚Äô. 
Children are often addressed as ‚Äòwatoto‚Äô (plural form) or ‚Äòtoto‚Äô (singular form).Njiru is cool.We are especting the president to kick-start the country‚Äôs ailing economy after four months of corona virus restrictions which have devastated key industries such as business,education,agriculture and tourism.

Summary of findings of the Study
Trends in cashew processing
The sector is beginning to develop into a modern ‚Äúi
n-dustry‚Äù. Developments in processing have been driven by costs including labor
. Investment  and  working 
capital  needs  for processors are rising.
Food safety, security and traceability driving change in 
the industry.
The  mechanization  trend  will  continue  making  new 
demands on processors.

Cashew processing equipment market
The  market  has  developed  into  a  large  market  with  a 
wide range of equipment and prices.Vietnam is the leader and most developed market.
There are no government trade barriers in the sector.
Suppliers  are  reluctant  to  do  business  in  Africa.  They see it as a high risk area therefore the Africa
n sector is served by a narrow base of suppliers. The market lacks 
competition.Brazilian  suppliers  can  offer  equipment  solutions  for small and medium processors in Africa

Processing in Africa
Processing remains a relatively small scale activity.
The ‚Äústeam and cut‚Äù model was the right choice for 
African  countries.  It  is  used  in  almost  all  processing units in Africa.
Management of new equipment is poor Labor
problems  are  the  major  concern  of  processors 
especially in East Africa.
Working conditions in cash
ew factories remain poor.I have already invested more than Us$800 in this project which i started in 2014 by product development and project launch by 2018,but i could not due to lack of enough capital.I have a mannual cutting machine that can only make 25kg in 8 hours compared to semi-automatic that process 35 to45 kg per  hour from vietnam.Iam now want to raise 100 donors who can donate $50 to kickstart this exciting innovation project.That i believe you can help me raise those donors&dollars.That small industry can create 50 job vacance,help 6000 farmers,2000 suppliers and 35,000 students that will benefit indirect with food,clothing and school fees.Think Global act Local!

this system umatiportal is where the website is managed from<>From functionality and appearance to navigation and coding integrity, a lot goes into creating an eye-catching, user-friendly website. It doesn't end there, either. Web developers and designers must work together to produce websites that will be located by search engines, engage customers, and stimulate conversions. Whew! That's a lot of pressure. Fortunately, tips will guide us through the process of creating a unique user experience that inspires viewers to become loyal brand advocates.(CMS)/software.        It's impossible to develop a great website without a functional program taking care of the backend. If you think of your website as a car, you can understand why. When friends see your shiny new sports car, they look at the sleek paint job, glistening tires, and luxurious leather seating. In the world of websites, this equates to the part of your site a user experiences directly. Just like the powerful engine in your sports car, the backend of your website is where the magic really happens. Without strong backend services, your website won't be able to "wow" your guests. Similarly, a sports car without an engine is rendered useless. One of the best "engines" for ecommerce sites is Magento, while WordPress is a customizable CMS ideal for informational sites. If you look at my facebook page it has contents that are eye catching about cashew nuts project,feeding programs,how can l add those contents to my site?but when you look at coachmicrofinance.netlify.com the issue of deployement is a challenge to a begginer.and i wish there could be a tutorial for a begginer for UmatiportalThe definition of clarity is the quality or condition of being clear or easy to understand. ..

I am my 12 yrs experience in cashew nut industry before. In my ... Or you can start small by doing trading the same commodity into the market.This is the most loved US nuts. Is cashew nut business profitable?
Based on the observations, economic analysis of cashew nut processing plant showed that, if the plant be operated with full capacity and efficiency then there would be profit of.60% on net..Food safety..Food safety certification combined with reliable and frequent laboratory testing helps create a positive image for cashew nut producers wishing to export to Europe. Sustainable production and the implementation of corporate social responsibility measures will help emerging suppliers gain an additional advantage. The toughest existing competitors for new suppliers of shelled cashew nuts are Vietnam and India. Vietnamese and Indian companies have the power to keep prices of cashew nuts relatively low because of their large-scale production and mechanised processing methods, excluding all expenses.As  i plan for product development and project launch,i only have two months to lay every thing down failure to which will operate fully for we need to stock almost 100 tones to process for 6 months if the semi-outomatic machine can be ready by mid jan-2021.I talked with Fundi who is an ingineer and has a small machine that help.My worry is how to raise US$1000 as seed capital.< > asante more power and support my brother in your work.

Every cashew nut that reaches the market goes through a lengthy process of growth, transport, and processing: at each stop along the way, the small seed gains value. According to the African Cashew Initiative, nearly 40% of the global cashew crop is produced by about 2.5 million small farmers in Africa. West Africa is one of the world‚Äôs largest producers of cashew nuts. Nonetheless, only around 10% of this production is processed in the region. The vast  majority of these farmers live in rural areas and struggle to make as little as US$ 1.9 to US$2.0 per day  through the production of cashews (ACi, 2011). The prospects for continued growth in demand for value-added cashew and other products in Africa constitute an incentive for increased attention to agro-industries development within the context of economic growth, food security and poverty-fighting strategies. Agro-industries, here understood as a component of the manufacturing sector where value is added to agricultural raw materials through processing and handling operations, are known to be efficient engines of growth and development. Adding to the problem is the fact that less than 5% of African raw cashew production undergoes further processing in Africa, leaving a tremendous opportunity for poverty reduction and job creation largely untapped.
The creation of Cashew processing agro-industries can contribute to lifting a significant number of African rural dwellers out of poverty through the additional wage earning employment opportunities created. In terms of an appropriate industrial approach, the high forward and backward linkages that can evolve from manufacturing and agro processing will contribute to boosting domestic investment, employment and output in the transformation
2. Process. Our company will be situated in in Njiru Nairobi where processing will be conducted. The Company will be operated by, Daniel Muriithi, EmilyKemunto and Orti
Organics Agro Processing intends with this financial and economical projection the idea will bring new concept in a market and good strategies which will enable the company to acquire a good market position. A yearly production of between 100 and 200 M/Tons is estimated in the first year and 1000 and 2000Ton by the 5th year. We aim to expand beyond this output within five years and look forward to tapping into the processing of other areas of processing such as Coconuts,mangoes,Bixer  mabuyu etc. As this is a seasonal product the nuts will be purchased and stored for production year round. We have currently identified three (3) destinations where produce will be source and they are: Lamu, Kilifi and Kware . Production time per annum is estimated to be 240 days. And the project intends to employ 40 staff during peak season.
Total production costs are estimated for the establishment of the factory is one million ($1,000.000) With all variables on point, the factory will start making profits from the second year of the project.
Our target market is Europe, starting off in the Netherlands and the United States of America (USA)Hoping to here from you as you prepare to have a joint venture to this exciting project.#mureithijarife on facebook

Introduction

This study diagnoses the current status of the cashew value chain in Kenya and identifies entry points for its further development. It aims at informing the
development of a strategy for the development of cashew nut as a subsector. This information is relevant for the development of the value chain development support as it is currently envisaged in the context of Project Cashew nut for income security for poor farmers in Coast of Kenya. 
(2019-2023). Rural people in Northern and Southern coast of Kenya face food insecurity. Integration of the cashew nut tree as a perennial cash crop seems to be an opportunity to increase farmer income. The main goal of this project is to enhance cashew nut production and productivity by introducing developing and maintaining cashew varieties with desirable traits, adapted to various agro-ecologies and acceptable to international markets as an additional source of income for the livelihoods of poor farmers in Kenya. This approach involves participatory research on the introduction of high yielding and adapted cashew varieties and transfer of knowledge on multiplication and production technologies. A value chain analysis on the entire chain from production to marketing will position the market opportunity. This knowledge and experience 
will be generated in a participative way with the target group and sustained by institutional networks. The findings will be drawn from existing analyses and will be complemented through information collected during field visits, consultations with key actors in the value chain and particularly with farmers. The author acknowledges
the limits of this information base and propose that a more detailed value chain analysis, particularly of the poorly understood internal marketing, processing and trade sector should be conducted during the initial stage of any project that engages in supporting the development of the value chain.

OVERVIEW ¬æ
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
ÔÇó	Estimates deemed realistic by NCM this new unit will generate a turnover of approximately 1.2m Jarife Nut Enterprises in the first year: then grow to 1.8m JNET then 60m in the fifth year with a net profit after tax and interest of about 500,000 in the first year, raising to 15m in the fifth year, The project shows an IRR of about 100% and a positive NPV at a rate a discount of 15% which correspond to the interest rate charged by most banks.
ÔÇó	The cumulative CAPEX for the first year is estimated at US$15,000 and US$16,000 first year as follow:
ÔÇó	New building and warehouse‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶.us$1500
ÔÇó	Equipments‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶..us$4000

ÔÇó	Total‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Approx    .us$ 15,000

ÔÇó	Large corporations might enjoy great success with an ROI of 10% or even less. Because small business owners usually have to take more risks, most business experts advise buyers of typical small companies to look for an ROI between 15 and 30 percent.

 Executive Summary
Over two billion people rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. The sector is plagued by inefficiencies.
Many farmers live in the poorest parts of the developing world. One in nine people goes to bed hungry.
At the same time, some 30% of food production goes to waste, and $1tn are lost along the value chain
each year Is digital enabler or solution?How can digital solutions benefit sustainable agriculture?
Introduction: 17 SDGs and many more challenges
Agriculture is crucial for achieving many of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Specifically, SDG 2, ‚ÄúZero Hunger‚Äù, calls for transformation of the global food system; ‚ÄúInvestments
in agriculture are crucial to increasing the capacity for agricultural productivity, and sustainable food
production systems are necessary to help alleviate the perils of hunger‚Äù. Today, however, in a world
that produces enough food for everyone, 820 million people still go to bed on an empty stomach. Many
others suffer from nutrient deficiencies.
Directly or indirectly, over two billion people rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. Many of them
form some of the poorest sections of society. Smallholder farmers (SHFs) are crucial for achieving SDG
1: No Poverty. When given the tools to succeed, SHFs increase not only their harvests, but also their
incomes. They can therefore send more children to school for longer, which in the long term further
stimulates local economies and reduces poverty. Farming leads the way here: the World Bank believes
that investing in agriculture is 11 times more effective in lifting people out of poverty than any other
sector [2]
.
However, SHFs face multiple challenges. They lack access to quality inputs, financing, insurance,
markets and transport. They often also lack up-to-date knowledge on the most appropriate technologies
and practices to grow, harvest, store and market better crops. Understandably, SHFs furthermore tend
to be risk-averse. They do not want to invest up front in new tools and practices when a bad season can
ruin their livelihoods.(Four of the many challenges faced across the smallholder sector are:)1.Poor market linkages and high numbers of intermediaries.2.Lack of Access to Finance3.Ageing farming populations 4.Inadequate ‚Äòenabling environments‚Äô. link:www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/feb/04/global-food-security-old-age-timebomb, r

 This Guide to value chain approaches provides the user with actionable methods and tools to
increase the productivity and performance of sub-Saharan African (SSA) agriculture.
The Guide is intended for use by a number of audiences. Most directly, it provides planners,
decision makers, and implementers with practical tools for creating effective value and supply
chain development programs. It also provides public and private stakeholders with a common
framework for prioritizing decisions on sector and sub-sector competitiveness. Policy makers,
business leaders, members of the development community, researchers, and practitioners can use
these methods and approaches to promote the development of traditional and non-traditional
value chains in sub-Saharan Africa.
Using concrete examples, mostly from African countries, this Guide presents, reviews, and
systematically illustrates a range of concepts, analytical tools, and methodologies which, in turn,
can be used to design, prepare, implement, assess, and evaluate agribusiness development
initiatives. It presents and comments on various conceptual, methodological, and practical

The focus of this book is the production and sale of high-value foods.
However, there is no simple definition of ‚Äòhigh-value‚Äô, as ‚Äòvalue‚Äô can have many
different meanings (value to a community, nutritional value, as a contribution
to national income etc.). In this book, the term ‚Äòhigh-value‚Äô refers to foods
that have a premium sale price, above that which would normally occur as a
result of processing. It is believed that this is the first time that information
on the demand for high-value foods, their production, marketing and quality
management has been gathered in a single publication.
This  IS the Opportunities in Food Processing series shares the overall FOCUS .: to enable small-scale  processors to
improve their access to markets and increase sales of high quality foods.
This not only benefits processors and consumers, but has other benefits in
their wider communities. Governments and development agencies recognise that small-scale food processing has many advantages over other income generating activities for employment creation, poverty alleviation, nutritional
improvement and economic development .Thats what i mean by guide.

lets talk tahnk you>How to start cashew nut processing business               Cashew Processing Business ‚Äî Area Required (Location) You should have the ownership of a land assessing around 500 sq.mt and that will be satisfactory for your little scale cashew nut preparing unit. The area must be smoothed and furthermore have an open space to dry out cashews in the sun.   Generally the processing of raw cashew nuts into edible cashew kernel takes the following steps traditional method: roasting, shelling drying, peeling, grading, quality controls, fumigation and packaging. All these steps have to be conducted with care to obtain good quality and good grade kernels. I have gone through Tezo blockchain and i found it good,and i created account .Thank you.so much sir we miss you in kenya.Tanya is doing a great job Blessed.
