The hashtags, DayZero and WaterCrisis have been trending this week in reference to February the first, when taps in the Western Cape province are expected to run dry. Premier of the Western Cape, Helen Zille, was set to meet with the National Disaster Management team yesterday and she's also reported to have written a letter to president Jacob Zuma, asking him to declare the water situation a national disaster.

After years of severe drought, Cape Town officials are preparing to shut off mains water supplies to a million homes. Residents have also been asked to limit their use to 50 litres a day as 'day zero' approaches

Is Cape Town facing a future without water?

May 18, 2018 is being called "Day Zero" in South Africa. By that day, the country's second largest city is projected to be without water and its dams at catastrophic levels. So how did Cape Town reach this point?

South Africa is experiencing a major drought. 2017 was the driest year in decades, and the third successive year of poor rainfall. Dams have gone unreplenished, underground aquifers are tapped out, springs and boreholes are running dry. Calls by the mayor's office to the city's more than 4 million residents to cut water use to less than 87 litres per person have gone unheeded. Fines have been flouted. And water has already been shut down for several hours a day in areas outside the city center.

Climatologists have pointed to climate change as a possible factor. And future projections show a shift towards a drier climate. Some activists even say the water crisis is political. They blame poor cooperation and coordination between the African National Congress ruling party, and the local and provincial government of the Western Cape run by the Democratic Alliance. Western Cape government officials say appeals to declare the province a disaster zone went unheeded by the ANC for months.

But a recent report by the South African Water Caucus found financial mismanagement and corruption in the local Department of Water and Sanitation, and that the city responded to warning signals too late. 

On Wednesday we'll take a look at the debate around the root of the crisis, and how Cape Town is planning for the near future. Join us at 1930GMT.

Water crisis continues to grip Cape Town, which is set to become the first major world metropolitan to run out of water if stringent water measures that have been put in place from today at only 50 litres of water per person per day come into effect. The city is desperate to avoid what is called day zero, or the day taps will run dry and 4 million people will have to stand in lines to get just 25 litres of water per person per day.
