## Sustainable Community Development Hub

was founded in May of 2017 "to serve as a hub for sustainable community development in order to provide trustworthy development & training tools to facilitate project planning, design & execution". Our vision statement is still being discussed and ironed out at our monthly meetings. At this time, SCD Hub archive team is working curation of our existing video library, testing methods of creating communication related feedback loops between the communities served by (past or present) sustainable community development projects, project leaders, young people, students, and other groups involved.
