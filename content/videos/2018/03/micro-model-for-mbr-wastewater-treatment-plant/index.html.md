Wastewater treatment plants are intended to be the main part of water reuse and recirculation into water network. There are different types of IWTP models in terms of hydraulic and process performance. Today, the application of MBR system in wastewater treatment process as an output filter for effluent is of primary importance.  This model is a small scale form of an urban wastewater treatment plant using extended aeration and MBR system. Operational details and utilities are employed inside it.

The term 'membrane bioreactor' (MBR) is generally used to define wastewater treatment processes where a perm-selective membrane eg microfiltration or ultrafiltration is integrated with a biological process - a suspended growth bioreactor. MBRs differ from 'polishing' processes where the membrane is employed as a discrete tertiary treatment step with no return of the active biomass to the biological process. - http://www.thembrsite.com/about-mbrs/what-are-mbrs/
