What is an eco city? What will tomorrow's green city look like? How do you build cities that do more with less to provide for ever-growing populations? 
Sustainable housing, energy efficiency, internmodal passenger transport, and smart grids for electrical distribution will all play a role in shaping the future of urban planning. 

This animated short film gets to the heart of the challenges we face in making  sustainable cities a reality.

The city of tomorrow is waiting just under the surface of our everyday lives. Together, we can make it happen.
