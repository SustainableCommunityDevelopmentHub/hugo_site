Practical Action has transformed the lives of communities living in remote Andean villages through the installation of micro-hydro plants providing electricity to over 30,000 people. Lack of access to electricity for these remote communities has restricted the economic development of the area with many people leaving in search of better opportunities. Since the arrival of micro-hydro the area is thriving as those who had left are returning, bringing their businesses with them, and others are also migrating to the area. Some villages have even doubled in size and for over 60% of villagers, their incomes have increased as a direct result of the micro-hydro power. Crucial to the success of the project is the involvement of the community. The villagers themselves contribute towards installation costs and are responsible for the day-to-day running of the plants. More and more villages are approaching Practical Action for installations and, so far, only a tiny fraction of the micro-hydro potential in the Eastern Andes has been exploited.
