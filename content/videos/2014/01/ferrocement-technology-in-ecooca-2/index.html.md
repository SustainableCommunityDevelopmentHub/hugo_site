Ferrocement is a technique which joins the flexibility of iron (steel) and the resistance of cement. Its best quality is to allow the building of many interesting forms that other techniques donÂ´t allow, or are more difficult or more expensive: round, circular; globular, spherical; cylindrical; curved ... and straight and angular of course.
