When we needed to expand our distribution center in Reno, Nevada we looked to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, certification standards as our guide to building a green building that balances environmental responsibility, resource efficiency and the comfort and well-being of our workforce. The Patagonia Footprint Chronicles allows you to track the environmental impact of a specific Patagonia product from design through delivery. 

Video covers the following subjects: 1. Storm-Water Runoff Management 2. Landscape and Exterior Design 3. Water Conservation and Energy Efficiency 4. Recycled and Environmentally Friendly Construction Materials 5. Green Housekeeping, Alternative Transportation and Recycling
