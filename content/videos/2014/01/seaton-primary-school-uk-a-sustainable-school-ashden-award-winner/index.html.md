Seaton Primary School in Devon lives out its school motto of 'Caring now for the Future', and is one of a few UK schools to install a range of renewable technologies. A 2.5 kW wind turbine and a 4.7 kW PV array on the roof of the school hall supply electricity directly to the school and have helped reduce CO2 emissions by about 2 tonnes a year. In addition, 48 m2 of solar water heating panels heat the school's outdoor swimming pool. Other green initiatives include class 'Energy Agents' to help reduce energy waste; the after-school 'Eco Club' to monitor energy use; a 2006 Energy Audit resulting in a host of energy efficiency measures; an orchard to provide fruit for pupils and save food miles; and a grey water collection system to supply the school wildlife pond and demonstrate small-scale water power.
