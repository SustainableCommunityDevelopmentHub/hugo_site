Climate change is rarely out of the headlines yet there appears to be continued controversy over the science.

In this captivating lecture, Professor Paul Valdes of Bristol's world-renowned Geographical Sciences department cuts through the popular misconceptions and the media hype and throws open the topic to ask what's really happening to the planet, and what scientists and policy makers can do about it.

With global temperatures rising and arguably more uncertainty than uncontested facts, Professor Valdes asks, is it a key issue for our times or the biggest science fraud in history?

The balance of evidence supports the premise that climate is changing due to our activities and that there will be substantial changes to our environment in the future.

So the question is whether this change is dangerous and whether there is anything that science can do to help solve our most urgent problems.
