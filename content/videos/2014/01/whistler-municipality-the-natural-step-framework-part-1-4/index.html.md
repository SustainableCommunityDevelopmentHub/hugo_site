This case study features interviews with Whistler's municipal decision makers about the decision making process used to evaluate a new Natural Gas pipeline and the long-term energy needs of the community using the Natural Step Framework, and working with Terasen Gas to evaluate options. Community consultation, co-operation, and partnerships resulted in a successful process. The 2010 Olympics allowed the pipeline to be built at the same time as the road from Vancouver to Whistler. Renewable energy and natural gas provided a blended solution with optimal capital costs, and a flexible platform. Other subjects include Return on Investment (ROI), TNS System Conditions, Environmental Costs, and Technology Innovations.
