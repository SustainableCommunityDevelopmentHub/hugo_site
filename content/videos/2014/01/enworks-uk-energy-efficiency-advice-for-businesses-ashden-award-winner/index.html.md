ENWORKS based in Greater Manchester is helping businesses in the North-West reduce their use of resources, cut their waste production -- and make huge cost savings. Almost 1,000 businesses are participating in the programme, saving them about £12 million a year from a total capital investment of only £5.5 million. The ENWORKS scheme is reducing CO2 emissions by an impressive 18,000 tonnes a year. An innovative online programme -- the ENWORKS Online Resource Efficiency Toolkit -- is used to identify ways each business can save resources and compare the savings, payback period and environmental benefits of each option. ENWORKS allocates specialist advisors to support each business through the process of making the appropriate behavioural and technical changes. The concept is now inspiring similar programmes in other parts of the country.
