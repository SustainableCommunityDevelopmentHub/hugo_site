 Appropriate and Sustainable Technology (AST) is critical in responding to the needs of developing communities worldwide. Such technology is usually characterized as being small scale, energy efficient, environmentally sound, and controlled by the local community. It must be simple enough to be maintained by the people using it. Furthermore, it must match the user and the need in complexity and scale and must be designed to foster self-reliance, cooperation, and responsibility (adapted from B. Hazeltine and C. Bull).
