Solarcentury is a beacon for the UK's solar power market, showing how attractive, flexible and easy to install solar PV can be, even in crowded urban areas. The company has used innovative design to develop a range of excellent solar products -- mainly solar PV panels and some solar water heating -- and mounting systems to fit a wide range of buildings, including industrial estates. It has designed and installed 550 solar systems across the country, meeting the rigorous standards of planners as well as clients.

Solarcentury's total installed capacity is around 3.3 MWp generating around 2,370 MWh/year which prevents the emission of about 1,350 tonnes of CO2 a year. One of its best known installations is the CIS tower in Manchester with the largest commercial solar fa√ßade in Europe.
