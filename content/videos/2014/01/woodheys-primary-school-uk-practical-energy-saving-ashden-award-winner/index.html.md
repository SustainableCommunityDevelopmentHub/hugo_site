Woodheys Primary School in Sale, Cheshire has an excellent programme of practical energy saving across the school and is proud to have achieved the Eco School green flag status. Working closely with expert organisations such as WWF it has created a high-quality curriculum for its pupils which has been widely praised and replicated. An energy audit in 1999 prompted energy efficiency actions which reduced gas consumption by 30% and a solar PV array was installed on the school roof in 2005 with an electronic display that allows pupils to easily monitor its electricity generation. Other measures include 'Eco Monitors' to encourage good energy saving and a Travel Plan encouraging cycling and walking to school. There is a strong emphasis on carrying behavioural change through to the pupils' homes and local community.
