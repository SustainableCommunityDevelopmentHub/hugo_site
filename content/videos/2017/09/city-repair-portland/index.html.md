<div id="content" class="style-scope ytd-expander">Mark Lakeman is a famous architect in Portland, OR. Why? After traveling around the world and seeing many cities from different cultures, Mark realized that one thing was missing from American cities: squares and plazas. Americans don't connect on the streets because there's no place to do so. Streets are designed for motorized traffic. Intersections aren't made to hang out. So Mark's "Communitecture" firm created a project called "City Repair". The idea: create beautiful spots all around town, built and designed in part by residents so that they would have a place to enjoy and hang out. One site at a time, Mark is helping people create their own original landmarks that will make them love their cities and know each other more.</div>
