Kombucha Brooklyn
Published on Aug 2, 2013

Kombucha is brewed in open-air vessels covered tightly with fine-weave cloth. Use culinary-grade ceramic, glass or stainless steel to ensure your 'buch will be the healthiest 'buch on your block. Here are some of our favorite vessels for fermenting 'buch.
This is the same jar that we supply in all of our 1-gallon Kombucha Home Brew Kits. Makes an excellent replacement, or if you want to expand your brewing capabilities, jump into a second or a third jar
Made in the USA specially for KBBK, guaranteed lead-free, and has a shorter, more discrete profile than our glass 1-gallon brew jars.
If you've got smaller batches under control, and are tired of wrangling many smaller vessels, just give 'em away and jump to 10 gallons.
This will fill 8 of our 32-oz growlers. One easy-to-clean vessel, a step up to the next level - one love for the 'buch.
Discrete and heavy duty, this crock will last a lifetime, and your mother will love her roomy new home. Consider L'Auto Siphon to make bottling a cinch!
