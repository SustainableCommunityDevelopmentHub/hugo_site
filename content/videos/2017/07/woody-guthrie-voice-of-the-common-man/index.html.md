Written and produced by Melissa Mergner in 2006, when she was a 14-year-old high school student, Woody Guthrie -- Voice of the Common Man is a short documentary about how the folk singer-songwriter overcame personal hardship and tragedy to become a spokesman for those Americans affected by the Great Depression and the dust storms. Although neither a politician nor activist, Guthrie brought attention to the plight of Okies, migrant workers and other disenfranchised people. He gave music a social conscience and influenced several generations of singer-songwriters, including Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, Steve Earle, John Mellencamp, Ani DiFranco and Jeff Tweedy. The film uses Guthrie's own voice from Library of Congress recordings, as well as archival footage from the '30s. Soundtrack by Richard Drueding.
