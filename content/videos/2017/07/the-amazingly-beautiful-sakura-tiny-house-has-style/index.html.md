The Sakura Tiny House was recently completely by Minimaliste Homes in Qu√©bec. The house literally has not only everything you'd except in a traditional home, but it's all done beautifully with some pretty darn impressive ways of going about it. I'd like to thanks Phil from Minimaliste for putting together this English version of The Sakura tiny house tour, thanks! See link below to their website.
