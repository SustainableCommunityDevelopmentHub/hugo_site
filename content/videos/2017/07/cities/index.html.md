We are working with a framework for Sustainable Community Development to support two primary campaigns

1 Anti-recidivism campaigns that give police options when two critical issues arise: (a) mental health issues when police are called and (b) drug overdose and addiction related calls.

2 Paris climate agreement implementation at the city level

City Networks & Sustainnable Community Development Frameworks

The The American Society of Landscape Architects Environmental Justice Professional Practice Networks has this to say on their [page](https://www.asla.org/contentdetail.aspx?id=46027):

Environmental justice addresses issues of: (1) unequal distribution of resources such as clean air and water, healthy food, homes, parks, places to walk and sit in public, etc.; (2) inaccessibility of public goods and resources because of transportation, cost or discrimination; and (3) exclusion from facilities and full participation in decisions about one's community largely because of poverty, prejudice, race, income, recent immigration, or other marginal status.
