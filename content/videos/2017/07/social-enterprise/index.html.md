How can you make sure that when you DO build it, they WILL come? The truth is, you can't - but there's a lot you can do to greatly improve your odds. In this workshop, Abby Fichtner, the i-lab's Hacker in Residence, walks you through a framework for identifying the right product to build for the right market.

In this highly interactive workshop, you'll hear case studies of what other startups have done and try out techniques yourself to help you craft your own strategy for:
- Finding a problem worth solving
- Deeply understanding your customer
- Finding a solution that resonates
- Knowing what to launch

Watchers can plan to walk away with some pragmatic guidance you can put to use immediately.
