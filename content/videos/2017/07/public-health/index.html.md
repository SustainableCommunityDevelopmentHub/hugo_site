Public Health 101: Introduction to public health
Public Health is a broad and evolving discipline. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Postdoctoral Association is pleased to present an overview of the five core areas of public health (epidemiology, biostatistics, social and behavioral sciences, environmental health, and health policy and management), with an inside peak of special topics from the experts. 

Participants will learn how to pose a research question and how to develop a study design (epidemiology and biostatistics), learn about gene-environment interactions (environmental health), safety climate research (social and behavioral sciences), and health financing (health policy and management).
