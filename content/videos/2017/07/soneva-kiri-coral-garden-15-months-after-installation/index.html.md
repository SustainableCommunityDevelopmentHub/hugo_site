The Soneva Kiri Coral Garden was set up by Coral Reef Creator's Team in Koh Kood - Thailand in October 2011. About 2000 coral fragments where grafted on this news coral reef ecosystem. This movie was released in January 2013. You can see the result 15 months after coral transplantation.

This is a useful video for its identification of common coral reef fish species as well.

The song played with the video gets an A rating as well, seeming to create its own meditative dancey coral reef restoration music genre.
