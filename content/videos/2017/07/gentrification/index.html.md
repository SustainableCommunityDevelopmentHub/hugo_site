Yeah this law is some pandering BS and addresses nothing. It won't stop or even slow down gentrification. It will just be a waste of taxpayer money as it is struck down as a 1st amendment violation.
Brokers suck. But they aren't the problem. Landlords, stupid zoning laws, and mega tall buildings designed to be tax shelters are the problem.

"data by Census tract from 1970 to 2010 shows that concentrated urban poverty has grown worse. The number of high poverty neighborhoods (where 30 percent or more of the population lives below the poverty line) has increased. ...  3.2 million poor people in 2010 lived in neighborhoods that were not high-poverty in 1970. The number of these census tracts nearly tripled from 1,100 in 1970 to 3,100 in 2010. "
