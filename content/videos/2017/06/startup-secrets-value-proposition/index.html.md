Learn how to define, evaluate and build your value proposition to ensure your venture can break out and build a compelling and sustainable business. Learn from Michael Skok, a serial entrepreneur turned venture capitalist, about "pain gain ratios" and other ways to assess whether you are creating, delivering, and harnessing value in your venture. 

This session also features a full case study from Actifio. The company's CEO, Ash Ashutosh, and CMO, Mike Troiano, cover Actifio's process for coming up with a strong value proposition.
