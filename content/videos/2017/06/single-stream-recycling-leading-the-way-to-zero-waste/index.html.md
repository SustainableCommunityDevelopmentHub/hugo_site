Boulder County Recycling Center, Boulder, Colorado presents "Single-stream Recycling-Leading the Way to Zero Waste." A [15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YaTpL8nl7c#) minute video offering an in-depth look at the single-stream recycling process at the Boulder County Recycling Center. The tour begins at the curbside recycling bin and follows the single-stream materials to the tipping floor of the Boulder County Recycling Center. Mr. Can, the star of the show, continues the recycling journey into the high-tech world of single-stream processing. Newspaper and office paper; corrugated cardboard; aluminum cans; glass bottles and jars; plastic bottles, tubs, jugs and jars; magazines and catalogs; and phone books are separated by a series of conveyors, pre-sorts, screens, cross-belt magnet, air classifier, Eddy current separator, glass cleaning system, organic separator, and finally a fines screen and vacuum. Action video explains each step of the way and provides a behind-the-scenes, up-close view of the equipment in action. The Boulder County Recycling Center is doing its part to help Boulder County become a Zero Waste Community by 2025. Because we're all in this together, remember to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Compost!
