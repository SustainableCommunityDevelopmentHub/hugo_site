3 million people live on the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia. Latrinology Tech, a group of Mechanical and Chemical Engineers from the University of Queensland, have designed a Latrine in conjunction with EWB Australia to be introduced into the communities of the lake. With this product, we aim to improve water quality and standards of sanitation in the region.
