Video diary from Robert Hughes - currently working with the floating communities of Cambodia as a field water & sanitation engineer for Engineers Without Borders Australia (EWB), and Live & Learn Environmental Education Cambodia. He's developing and trialling appropriate low-cost sanitation options for communities that spend most or all of them their time living on water.
