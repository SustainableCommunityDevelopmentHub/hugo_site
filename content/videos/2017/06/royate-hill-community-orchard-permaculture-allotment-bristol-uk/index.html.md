On a little South facing valley slope in the English City of Bristol is nestled a beautiful example of Organic Permaculture gardening for all to learn from and be a part of. In amongst the many varieties of fruit trees, it's easy to forget you're in a City. Come and join in with the joys of the Community Orchard and Permaculture Allotment, share skills and food with folk and glean some nuggets of wisdom from the marvellous noggin of Mike Feingold.
