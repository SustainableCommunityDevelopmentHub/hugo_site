##  Bumble Fumble a do-able native bee survival plan for cities.

## PARKING LOTS CAN SAVE THE BEES

The bees are dying, but there is something we can do to fix it. Watch BumbleFumble Founder, Danielle Bilot, present on how parking lots and other small green spaces can save the majority of our diverse, urban bees.

## GO NATIVE

Did you know... that there are over 4000 native bee species in the U.S. alone? They are more efficient, free of cost, and the vast majority do not sting.

Danielle's request to cities and people living in urban areas is to provide short range habitat for the smaller non-honey bee pollinators which have shorter ranges of flight, as well as 12-15 sq. foot minimum areas in parking lots and other open spaces. In her TED talk, she shows how native bee survival rates can be dramatically increased by ensuring that there are many more short flight range opportunities.

 The rapid decline of bee populations will have a devastating impact on agriculture. The problem seems insurmountable, so what can we do about it? Danielle Bilot argues that urban areas can help save the bees - it's simply a matter of design.

Danielle studied landscape design at the University of Oregon and is a champion for native pollinator species. She worked on the White House Pollinator Action Plan and continues to give presentations at professional conferences around the U.S. She is passionate about teaching people how to create native bee habitats.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at
