<div>System demonstrated in the video shows how a small pond it used to store overflow, and how the rain bench diverter/ filter system works.</div>

<div id="content" class="style-scope ytd-expander">We just built a rain harvesting system using the do-it-yourself rain bench by Second Rain. We put it in our yard about 12 feet from the Saving Rain diverter that is in the downspout on the corner of our house. This bench will hold 65 gallons of rainwater and very affordable. We only had to purchase 1 sheet of plywood and some 2x2's. So I have a rain collection unit and a bench!</div>
