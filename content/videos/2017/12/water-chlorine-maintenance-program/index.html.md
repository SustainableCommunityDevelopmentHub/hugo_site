The free chlorine maintenance does not affect water quality, and the water remains safe for use.  Consumers who are sensitive to taste and odor changes in drinking water might notice a slight change during this period, however this palatability change does not alter the quality of the drinking water.

The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) has scheduled a free chlorine maintenance that will be conducted on its water transmission system and customer cities' distribution systems for a 28-day period from March 7-April 4. The free chlorine maintenance is a water system maintenance function as well as a water conservation measure.  As a member city, Richardson receives its water from NTMWD. 

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) allows water suppliers to perform a free chlorine maintenance in order to maintain proper chloramine levels (required by TCEQ) during the warm weather periods, thus conserving water. 

The chloramines, a combination of chlorine and ammonia, are used to provide the disinfectant residual in the transmission and distribution systems as required by the TCEQ.  Chloramines provide a longer lasting residual disinfection in the water pipelines and water storage facilities.

The free chlorine maintenance does not affect water quality, and the water remains safe for use.  Consumers who are sensitive to taste and odor changes in drinking water might notice a slight change during this period, however this palatability change does not alter the quality of the drinking water.
