**Infiltration/Inflow** (**I/I**) causes dilution in [sanitary sewers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_sewer "Sanitary sewer"). Dilution of sewage decreases the efficiency of treatment, and may cause sewage volumes to exceed design capacity. Although inflow is technically different from infiltration, it may be difficult to determine which is causing dilution problems in inaccessible sewers. The [United States Environmental Protection Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency "United States Environmental Protection Agency") defines the term infiltration/inflow as combined contributions from both.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"></sup>
