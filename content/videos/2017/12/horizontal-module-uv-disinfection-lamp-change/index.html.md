This video is about changing UV wastewater lamps in a horizontal configuration.    The plant maintains 100 modules each with 6 lamps.  The video is generic and meant to show engineers, owners and operators the maintenance involved.  Entire lamp change would be 40 hours x 2 operators.

note that some systems come with self cleaning rings which are moved along the glass surface to keep optical transmission high.
