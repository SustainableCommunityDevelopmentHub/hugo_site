Flow rate and operation of slow sand filter explained along with gradiation of fine sand and gravel below the source water.

Flow rates of 0.015-0.15 gpm/ ft^2 expected for typical performance with entry water of < 10 NTU..

Two day period of establishing Schmutzdecke Algal layer on the surface of the slow sand filter is explained and
how that period sends water passing though back to the waste water well rather than stored in the clearwell.
