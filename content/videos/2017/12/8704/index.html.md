<div id="content" class="style-scope ytd-expander">In this video I cover the complete fresh water system for our cabin. We harvest rainwater for our needs. We use gutter system on the house to dump into five 55 gallon barrels then into a 250 gallon tote. We then transfer it into other storage when we can. Also we transfer it into our main 250 gallon tote to supply our home. We use a 4.5 amp well pump to move the water into the cabin then it is filtered with a 3 stage filter system. Sediment, carbon and Carbon blocker. It really insures the water is just water. We use a instant on LPG hot water heater to supply our hot water needs.</div>
