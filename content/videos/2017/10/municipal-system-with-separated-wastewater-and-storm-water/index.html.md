Have you ever wondered what happens to water and other substances when they are flushed down our drains and toilets? It shouldn't be a mystery, and the City of Windsor and the Detroit River Canadian Cleanup initiative have partnered to create a wastewater video to help de-mystify the topic, and educate viewers.

Video describes issues with public sewer systems, items that cause blockages and clogs. Protecting against overloading of municipal waste systems.  How pharmaceuticals and chemicals cause problems in municipal systems and storm drains which flow out to rivers.
