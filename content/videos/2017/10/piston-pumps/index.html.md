Nice video! I have an old exercise bike hooked up to a Meijer Bulldozer Piston Pump works great very easy to pedal and get pressure. Maybe I'll add solar into it!﻿ - MrFlyTWA - 3 years ago

Don't pressure test to max head on a diaphragm tank, the diaphragm will stretch and break!     This can happen at around 30/40 psi above the tanks air charge!    You notice around 75 psi in this video it begins to rapidly rise in psi, that's the diaphragm reaching it's limit.    It can not stretch any more and all its doing is compressing steel and pvc.
