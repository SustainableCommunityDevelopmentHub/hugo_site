Hempcrete is not a new building material, in fact, its rather ancient, but it has gained new traction and popularity amongst sustinbale builders and construction companies. It is favored for its carbon-negative properties as a building material and the sustainability of hemp crop. Hempcrete is a type of "concrete" brick where the aggregate, instead of gravel or some other sand or stone mixture, is the fibrous part of hemp stalks. The hemp stalks are mixed with lime and water or sometimes a different binding agent, and then compressed into bricks.
