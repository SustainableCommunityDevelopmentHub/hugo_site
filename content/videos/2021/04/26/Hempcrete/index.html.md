## What is Hempcrete?:
Hempcrete is a type of "concrete" brick where the aggregate, instead of gravel or some other sand or stone mixture, is the fibrous part of hemp stalks. The hemp stalks are mixed with lime and water or sometimes a different binding agent, and then compressed into bricks. 
Hempcrete is not a new building material, in fact, its rather ancient, but it has gained new traction and popularity amongst sustainbale builders and construction companies. It is favored for its carbon-negative properties as a building material and the sustainability of hemp crop. 

## Pros and Cons of Hempcrete:
Like any building material, hempcrete has its benefits and its limitations. Unlike conventional portland concrete or other concretes and cements, hempcrete is carbon negative, which means it actually absorbs carbon out of the surrounding air and by doing so becomes stronger whereas conventional concrete emit CO2 emissions. Hempcrete is also nontoxic, excellent at insulating, regulates humindity, is  fire, pest, and mold resistant.
The downside of hemp is that it is not reliable for loadbearing walls during its curing process, and can take quite a while to cure when poured as a slurry into a wall form. This is combatted by hempcrete manufacturers by using bricks, which cure faster, or by using wooden forms in the wall along with the hempcrete. Once hempcrete is cured, though, it slowly petrifies and becomes very strong and can last for hundreds of years.
