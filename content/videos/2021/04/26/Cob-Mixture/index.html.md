Cob is a mud-like mixture of soil, straw, and water. The soil is roughly composed of sand and clay. Cob is an easy and fast-drying material that is most often used for the construction of [Cob Houses](). Cob, once dry, is usually coated with a plaster in order to seal it from the elements and give it an appearance unique to the builder's choosing. Cob is incredibly moldable and make for extremely customizable structures, therefore people who use it to build homes often create unique and fantastical structures. Almost anyone can build cob houses, as long as one has the right tools, a detailed plan, and friends to help in the process.
