# Cob and How it's Used

## Cob Mixture
Cob is a mud-like mixture of soil, straw, and water. The soil is roughly composed of sand and clay. Cob is an easy and fast-drying material that is most often used for the construction of [Cob Houses](https://www.homecrux.com/ten-best-cob-houses-and-the-benefits-of-building-one/93879/). Cob, once dry, is usually coated with a plaster in order to seal it from the elements and give it an appearance unique to the builder's choosing. Cob is incredibly moldable and makes for extremely customizable structures, therefore people who use it to build homes often create unique and fantastical designs. Almost anyone can build cob houses, as long as one has the right tools, a detailed plan, and friends to help in the process.

## Why use cob:
Cob is sustainable and cheap since it can be sourced from the build site itself and because straw can be purchased for low prices from local farms or feed-and-tack stores. Cob is typically sealed with plaster, thus making it weatherproofed and suitable for most climates: though, in climates where some seasons can be cold and wet, it is best to limit construction of cob houses to summers where the weather is warm and dry. 
Cob is a material with high thermal capacity, giving it excellent passive cooling/warming capabilities and insulating properties, therefore limiting energy consumption.
