Adobe bricks are the oldest type of brick in the Western Hemisphere. What makes them unique is their soil composition: adobe soil is composed of clay, quarts, and other minerals. Adobe soil is found in Central America, Mexico, and the southwestern United States. Adobe bricks are formed by baking in the sun and are fireproof, durable, biodegradable, and non-toxic like many other kinds of bricks. They have high thermal mass, providing excellent thermal insulation.
