## What is adobe?:
Adobe, in today's time, mainly refers to 20th century Southwestern adobe style architecture, but also refers to the bricks themselves. Adobe consists of clay, sand, silt, water, and a fibrous binding material such as finely chopped straw. After the components are mixed, adobe is either moulded into bricks or hand manipulated into courses, and then left to dry in the sun. 

## Adobe history:
Adobe architecture was used widely in ancient civilizations from what's now known as Southwest America down to Peru. The word adobe, though, came from Spanish. Adobe construction, also known as mudbrick construction, is a very ancient method of building and can be found essentially in any ancient or modern civilizations where the climate is mostly hot and dry. [1]

## Why use adobe:
Adobe is a sustainable and low-cost material that can be used in a variety of ways. Adobe has a high thermal capacity and low thermal conductivity[2], making it an ideal material for hot and dry climates that quickly become cold at night. Adobe walls passively heat and cool the interior of buildings by storing up heat throughout the day and releasing it into the interior at night. Passive heating and cooling is much more sustainable and energy efficient than modern HVAC systems which make up 6% of all electricity consumtion in the United States alone [3].
However, adobe, specifically unbaked adobe, would not be ideal for wet climates since they will eventually dissolve and erode away when rained on or exposed to moisture. There are methods for making adobe constructions last much longer, such as baking the bricks, but is still a more ideal material for airid climates.
