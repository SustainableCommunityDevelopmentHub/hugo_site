# What are mudbricks?:
Mudbricks are a mixture of loam, mud, sand, water, and an organic substrate for binding such as straw or rice husks; they are then moulded into bricks with wooden moulds and left to dry in the sun. With mudbricks you can use them as insulation, or as walls themselves. Mudbricks have a high thermal mass, giving them good insulation capabilities that keep interiors cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. However, mudbricks do not have a long life span when left exposed to wind and rain. They will slowly dissolve in water and be eroded away. Mudbricks can be made stronger by firing them in a kiln.

# History of mud bricks:
Mudbricks date back to the pre-pottery neolitic era (10,000-8,800 BCE). They were used by many ancient cultures around the world, independently, creating slight variations in methods and uses, but are still commonly used in present day. Mudbrick may also be referred to as adobe. Adobe is a spanish word for mudbrick construction. Today, adobe refers more broadly to what's now considered the Adobe Style and less so the actual building methods.
