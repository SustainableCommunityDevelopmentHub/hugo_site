Aqua privy The conventional aquaprivy is essentially a small septic tank located directly below a squatting plate which has a drop pipe extending below the liquid level in the tank to form a simple water seal.

Aqua Privy is a modified form of Septic Tank. It is more useful where water carriage system is absent and availability of water is limited. There is no need to flush this toilet. This pucca latrine can be constructed on a smaller area with the tank below.

An aqua-privy has a watertight tank immediately under the latrine floor. Excreta drop directly into the tank through a pipe. The bottom of the pipe is submerged in the liquid in the tank, forming a water seal to prevent escape of flies, mosquitos and smell. The tank functions like a septic tank. Effluent usually infiltrates into the ground through a soakpit. Accumulated solids (sludge) must be removed regularly. Enough water must be added to compensate for evaporation and leakage losses.
