Drainage field planning
============================================= 

DESCRIPTION

a drain field should be sized to support a community of aerobic soil microorganisms capable of decomposing the anaerobic septic tank's effluent into aerobic water. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_drain_field

Several factors may reduce observed percolation rates when the drain field receives anoxic septic tank effluent:
- microbial colonies catabolizing soluble organic compounds 
- Insoluble particles accumulating at soil interface
- Cooking fats / petroleum products emulsified by detergents or dissolved by solvents can flow through prior to anaerobic liquefaction  - resultant hydrophobic layer .[7]
- high groundwater levels
- frozen ground
