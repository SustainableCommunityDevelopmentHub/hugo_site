Reclaimed Wood
============================================= 

Reclaimed wood is a great way to rennovate existing buildings, build unique furniture, and/or use for for new structures. Although reclaimed wood has unique qualities, can be cheaper to obtain, and is more sustainable than cutting down trees, it comes with its own safety precautions as many reclaimed woods are old and may have insect infestations/fecal matter, lead paint residue, chemical treatment residue, etc. But, hope is not lost, there are a number of ways to identify unsafe woods and restore it to a usable condition.
