## Recycled Pallet Wood Safety
Pallets are a popular and cheap (sometimes free) source for reclaimed wood, but not all pallet woods are safe for use indoors where children, pets, and people with immune disorders reside. Some pallets are treated with harsh chemicles to kill pests, while others might have endured chemical spills in a warehouse, or been stored for long periods of time in uncontrolled environments leaving them susceptible to mold, mildew, and pests. Understanding the symbols marked on pallets as well as knowing where they are coming from and how to treat them before use is important to ensuring your pallets will not pose a health threat to you or your household.
