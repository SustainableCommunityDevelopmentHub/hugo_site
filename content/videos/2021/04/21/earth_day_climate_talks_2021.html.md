Earth Day 2021 - some ideas for personal action
============================================= 

Carbon levy - help the most vulnerable, implimentation pathway
- sector wide transformation is necessary

Carbon footprint lighting switch
- LED lighting switch over-  radical savings. 1/2 ton of CO2 savings
- Energy efficient appliances
- 100% renewable energy source. cost was less. (really?)
- Smart heating and cooling controls 1/2 ton savings
- Efficient heating system
- insulate home saved 1 ton of CO2 
- reducre flying based travel
