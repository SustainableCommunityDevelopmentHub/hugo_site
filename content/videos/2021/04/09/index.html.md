Oxidation ditch
============================================= 

DESCRIPTION
An  oxidation  ditch  is  a  modified  activated  sludge biological treatment process that utilizes long solids retention  times  (SRTs)  to  remove  biodegradable organics.  Oxidation ditches are typically complete mix systems, but they can be modified to approach plug flow conditions.  (Note: as conditions approach plug  flow,  diffused  air  must  be  used  to  provide enough  mixing.    The  system  will  also  no  longer operate  as  an  oxidation  ditch).    Typical  oxidation ditch treatment systems consist of a single or  multi-channel   configuration   within   a   ring,   oval,   or horseshoe-shaped  basin.    As  a  result,  oxidation ditches   are   called   “racetrack   type”   reactors. Horizontally or vertically mounted aerators provide circulation,  oxygen  transfer,  and  aeration  in  the ditch.
