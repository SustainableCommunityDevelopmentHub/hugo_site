Municipal Solid Waste Transfer via Compactor Truck
============================================= 


"Steel-wheeled landfill compactor is the industry-accepted means of achieving optimum density. "

Compactors are typically used as a result of public mandate, as laws like the following for Milpitas Canada have become common.
"No more than one weekâ€™s accumulation of Solid Waste shall be kept or be permitted to remain upon any Premises in the City unless a Commercial Compactor is installed."

A compactor truck allows waste containers to be emptied into the vehicle from the rear, front or sides and inhibits vectors (of disease) from reaching the waste during collection and transport. It works poorly when waste stream is very dense, wet, collected materials are gritty or abrasive, or when the roads are dusty.
