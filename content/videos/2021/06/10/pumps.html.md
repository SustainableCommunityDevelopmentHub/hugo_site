# Water pumps: Common problems and comparison of methods of repair

This resource provides a thourough guide on diagnosing and troubleshooting water pump issues: https://inspectapedia.com/water/Water_Pump_Repair_Guide.php#MasterIndex
Some common issues and solutions are detailed below, with additional refereneces. 

## Pressure switch
One of the most common problems in a pump is the pressure switch.  The pressure switch monitors the pressure of water and turns the pump on or off.
If your pump is not running when it should be, you may have a faulty pressure switch. This could be for a number of reasons:
-  No water or not enough water is not reaching the pressure switch
-  Pressure switch is not wired or connected correctly
-  Pressure switch is damaged

- View this guide on troubleshooting pressure switch issues:

A damaged pressure switch can sometimes be repaired, but it is often cost-effective to replace it.

## Running pump dry / not priming

 - Priming a water pump means to remove all the air from the system.  Water pumps need to be primed before use.
 - Involves filling the pump system with water usually through a designated port called the prime plug or prime opening.
 - This website explains the priming process in more detail: https://inspectapedia.com/water/Prime_The_Well_Pump.php

Video 1 shows an example of priming a pump.  NOTE: It is not recommended to prime pump while running

## Mechanical seal issue
If your water pump is not leaking water, there may be a leak or other issue with the mechanical seal. Replacing a mechanical seal or gasket will be different for every pump, but follows the same basic process.  

  1. Disconnect power and drain if required
  2. Disassemble pump 
  3. Remove old seal
  4. Clean and lubricate where necesarry
  5. Replace seal or gasket and reassemble

It is best to consult the directions specific to your water pump.  This information can usually be found in the operations manual or on the manufacturers website.  
See this video for one example of a mechanical seal replacement:

## Impeller damage
In centrifugal pumps, the impeller can be damaged, which will 
## Improper wiring
Improper or damaged wiring can also cause a pump to malfunction or stop working.  One way to investigate electrical issues is to test wires for power and resistance. 
Water pumps typically come in 2-wire and 3-wire configurations.  This guide explains the difference between 2-wire and 3-wire pumps and how they are wired: https://www.waterpumpsdirect.com/stories/1852-Well-Pump-Installation-Guide.html

Pump Wiring
If the insulation on the wiring is damaged, electricity will leak out.  To test for defective wires measure the resistance. This video explains one method of testing the insulation of well pump wires.

The measured resistance can mean different things, depending on what the value is:
- Low Resistance: Leak in insulation (usually a nick or cut somewhere along the wire)
- Zero or Near Zero Resistance: A short in the circuit wiring
- Infinite or Very Large Resistance: Break in circuit
