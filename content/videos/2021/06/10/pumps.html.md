# Commmon water lifting & transport pumps, common problems and comparison of methods of repair

## Reasons for water pump failure:
### 1.  Running pump dry / not priming
a.	Priming a water pump means to remove all the air from the system.  Water pumps need to be primed before use.
b.	Involves filling the pump system with water usually through a designated port called the prime plug or prime opening.
c.	This website explains the process in more detail: https://inspectapedia.com/water/Prime_The_Well_Pump.php

NOTE: It is not recommended to prime pump while running



### 2.	Leaking gasket or seal issue
### 3.	Broken / damaged parts 
### 4.	Impeller damage
### 5.	Improper wiring

### 6.  Pressure switch
a.	Another area of malfunction in a pump is the pressure switch.  The pressure switch monitors the pressure of water and turns the pump on or off.
