When sizing a water pump, the most important factors to consider are 
### Flow Rate:
- Flow rate is how fast the pump can move water.  
- Usually measured in Gallons per Minute (GPM) or Liters per Minute (LPM)
### Head:
- Pump head is the vertical distance that the pump can move water.  
- Usually measured in feet or meters.
Total head accounts for the suction head and the discharge head of the pump.  

The image below as well as the following website provides a basis for understanding pump head and the differences between suction and discharge head:
