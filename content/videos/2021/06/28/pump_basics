When sizing a water pump, the most important factors to consider are 
Flow Rate:
Flow rate is how fast the pump can move water.  
Usually measured in GPM or LPM
Head:
Pump head is the vertical distance that the pump can move water.  
Usually measured in feet or meters.
Total head accounts for the suction head and the discharge head of the pump

The following website provides a basis for understanding pump head and the differences between suction and discharge head:
