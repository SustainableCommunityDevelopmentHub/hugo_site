# Amphibious Architecture and Buoyant Foundations

## What is Amphibious Architecture?: 
Amphibious architecture "refers to an alternative flood mitigation strategy that allows an otherwise-ordinary structure to float on the surface of rising floodwater rather than succumb to inundation" [1]. 

## What are buoyant foundations?: 
Buoyant foundations are the foundation part of amphibious architecture which allows a structure to float as high as needed when flooding occurs and sink back down to its exact original loacation. 
The foundations are retrofitted to existing structures or designed with new structures. 

## Why are buoyant foundations used and important?: 
Buoyant foundations are a sustainable and accessible solution for communities frequently, and with worsening intensity, impacted by seasonal flooding and/or rising sea levels. 
Buoyant foundations allow pre-existing strucutres to adapt to the worsening climate without suffering repetitive damage, risking illness due to water contamination, and causing families and communities to be displaced.

## The Buoyant Foundation Project: 
The [Buoyant Foundation Project](https://www.buoyantfoundation.org/home) is a non-profit founded by Elizabeth English in 2006 as a solution for communities in New Orleans that were devastated by flooding caused by hurricain Katrina. 
The project expanded over the years to help more communities around the world facing similar issues such as in Vietnam, Jamaica, and Nicaragua. 
Elizabeth English's inspiration for the project came from the Netherlands where an amphibious community in a flood-prone region was being developed along the Maas river [2]. 
The developers in the Netherlands were using hollow concrete boxes for buoyancy in their architecture, but since that method is more costly and not as easily retrofitted to pre-existing and historic housing, English gathered a team, founding the [Buoyant Foundation Project](https://www.buoyantfoundation.org/home) and together developing a more inexpensive and simple solution for New Orleans [2].
The solution English and her team came up with was relatively cheap and easily installed by at least two, non-expert, handy individuals without need for heavy machinery/equipment. 
The result was a metal frame fitted to the bottom of the original foundation of a home, held in place by four or more pillars in which the entire structure can rise and fall with the flood water height on a fixed vertical axis [2].
