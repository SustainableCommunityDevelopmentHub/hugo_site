# Mushrooms and Architecture

## What are mushroom bricks?: 
Mushroom bricks, otherwise known as mycelium bricks, are bricks made from an organic substrate, such as corn husks, rice hulls, soybean hulls, woodchips, or saw dust, and mycelium, the “roots” of mushrooms, where the organic substrate is consumed by the mycelium [1]. The result is a solid and lightweight mass in the shape of the mould of one’s choosing. 

## Pros and Cons of mushroom bricks:
As an up-and-coming green building material, mushroom bricks have a lot of potential as a sustainable construction material -- for structural use, insulation, and even furniture. This is because they are made with the waste product of other industries, produce zero carbon waste, and are biodegradable. The other qualities it has is that it can trap more heat than conventional fiberglass insulation and it is stronger pound for pound than concrete [2]. This makes it a promising material for carbon neutral and carbon negative structures. 
<p> But, there are always disadvantages to any building material. For mushroom bricks the most major disadvantage is its lifespan: depending on the environmental conditions and substrate-mycelium combination, the material could last as little as 6 weeks to 20 years before decomposing [2]. The cause of such a short life span is due to overexposure to moisture and humidity, and/or unstable climate. Despite this, there are solutions one can use to avoid a too-short lifespan for their mushroom bricks such as keeping the bricks off of the ground and protected from the weather [2]. With their lifespan in mind, these bricks are best suited for places with more stable climates where it's not too wet and the seasons do not change drastically.<p>

## How they're made:
To create mushroom bricks Takes time. The most common bricks are made up of oyster mushrooms and sawdust for bricks and insulation purposes. Once one has decided on a substrate-mycelium mixture, then the mold is next. Plastic moulds are best suited for this since they will require less washing [2]. It is best to avoid wooden moulds, and glass or metal ones can work, but will require more maintenance. The mould should be air tight with a lot of humidity on the inside and some holes for gas exchange [2]. It should also be kept in mind that the properties of the chosen mycelium and substrate will be more or less reflected in the finished product, therefore the mycelium and substrate should be chosen and tested for the desired purpose.
