Activated sludge process wastewater treatment methods
=============================================

The activated sludge process is a type of wastewater treatment process for treating sewage or industrial wastewaters using aeration and a biological floc composed of bacteria and protozoa. The general arrangement of an activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous pollution includes the following items: An aeration tank where air is injected in the mixed liquor. This is followed by a settling tank to allow the biological flocs to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water.- wikipedia[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_sewerage]

a series of stages, which firstly separates the raw or primary sludge, then separates the waste activated sludge and finally involves disinfection and clarification of the effluent.
