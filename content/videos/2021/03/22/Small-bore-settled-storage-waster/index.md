Small bore settled storage wastewater transfer
=============================================

Small-bore sewerage, is a sewer system that collects all household wastewater in small-diameter pipes laid at fairly flat gradients. Simplified sewers are laid in the front yard or under the pavement or - if feasible - inside the back yard, rather than in the centre of the road as with conventional sewerage.
