Municipal Solid Waste Storage Household Bin
============================

Management of our own waste at the household level allows family groups to work together toward waste reduction and upcycling.  Separating compostables, reclaimmable metals, fabrics and plastics for local products is common in many rural settings.  Sadly , at the time of writing it is very common for household waste that enters a household bin to be burned on the property.  

Efforts continue to grow and develop as waste piles in many ports and 'waste recipient nations' like Malaysia and African countries as we witness geopolitical changes in solid waste management related to china's announcement that they will no longer be accepting waste from other developed countries' waste streams in 2018.
