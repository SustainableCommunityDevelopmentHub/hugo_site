Biogas Research review 
=============================================




Biogas digester planning in Nairobi - Rastronics/ Mamawatoto Eco School

Oltea Chai Zamani has been working with the waste management and energy systems for Mamawatoto Eco School. To enable a proper school. the toilet facility has to be made up to snub, so Oltea has been consulting with different builders in his community of Njiru, Nairobi, Kenya, and nearby Kibera to get a better understanding of what they have been building and what their knowledge of operation and maintenance of active biogas systems. 

Researching the status quo of biodisester projects, we have seen adoption of flexible bladders, Manawatoto team is evaluating local production options from the waste stream as complared with imported flexible 2 m^3 bladder for $80, use of truck tires is common for storing produced gas.  Many small systems seem to be using 'un-scrubbed' produced gas. This will have health related effects unless H2S scrubbers are used.

The simple first step plan is to manage a small containment and gas storage system for domestic cooking gas production.  The second step to improve the process is to remove Hydrogen Sulfate contaminants
