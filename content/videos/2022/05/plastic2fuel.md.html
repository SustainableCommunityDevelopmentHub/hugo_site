  <b>use of zeolite catylist brings pyrlysis temperature down from 680C to 350 C</b>
  
  <b>compatibility with small alumnimum smelting 'home systems'.
    
  <b>Caring for human health and the environment to catch drips and other unintended discharges of pyrolysis oil</b>
    
    <ul>Steps to take in advance
      <li>spill collection systems around spigots</li>
      <li>good hose clamp connectors, mechanical system safety by design.
      <li>other safety procedures. - ventilation, safe space, eye wash and shower.
      <li>knowledge that 'pyrolysis gas' can cause carbon monoxide poisoning if pyrolytic chamber is vented without proper ventilation.
       <li>undertanding of the local surface and drainage water near fuel storage and production can prevent disaster</li>
    </ul>
