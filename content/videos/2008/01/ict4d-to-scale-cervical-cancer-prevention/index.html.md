We developed a software application that would facilitate the use of mobile device to transport images taken by nurses at health care centers (point-of-care) in rural Zambia to a server in Lusaka where doctors can access the images in order to provide expert advice on cervical lesions. We plan to use this application to facilitate a scalable national cervical cancer screening program.
