Rain barrels are common and should have enough capacity to rotate the tracking solar accumulator. Bob suggested using one rain barrel and letting the water run to your garden. Dripper waterer! 
This is much simpler than using 2 buckets and it might work well.
Here is my suggestion for keeping it resistant to wind gusts.
