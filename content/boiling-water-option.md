"Boiling water is effective to purify it by killing bacteria, pathogens, and organic impurities but does not remove chemicals like chlorine, fluorine, iron, magnesium, and lead." - https://hometuff.com/water/does-boiling-water-purify-it-kill-bacteria-chemicals/

"Boiling can be used as a pathogen reduction method that should kill all pathogens. Water should be brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute. At altitudes greater than 6,562 feet (greater than 2000 meters), you should boil water for 3 minutes." - https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html
