In another shock to atmospheric scientists and the global community, the United States was the only nation to reject the Paris Accord Climate Convention in January of 2018.  Insurance lobbies are facing off with extractive indistry lobbies armed with the foresight of economic outcome models. Climate related disaster costs are pressuring industries, governments and consumers to step up carbon emission reductions, in order to reduce the climate related pressures of coastal flooding, superstorms, and urban pollution.


To stabilize, our biospheric climate requires of us new patterns of living sustainably, particularily by recognizing the increased vulnerability and loss of qualit of life humanity and other species face if climate destabilization is not formally recognized and addressed with action in all developed nations. Our atmosphere is buffered by many terrestrial dynamical systems from arctic ice, limestone, dissolved salts, suspended solids, etc. SCD Hub stands firm on the scientifically validated statement that greater awareness of the human contribution to atmostperhic and oceanographic system variations protect human quality of life now and for future generations yet to come.
