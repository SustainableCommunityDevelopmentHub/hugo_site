To serve as a hub for sustainable community development (SCD) in order to provide trustworthy development & training tools to facilitate project planning, design & execution. Our current work emphasizes the life cycle of water.
<BR><BR>

SCD Hub serves as a library of content (e.g. video, graphics, literature) related to water resources. Our aim in curating content is to clearly assess what approaches work and what approaches have challenges, and what kind? 


<BR><BR>
Hence  [Peacewater Docs](http://sharaj2.sg-host.com) This site provides the Peacewater/SCD Hub community with a forum.

If you wish to suggest a learning resource ( video, document, web url ), please share it in the comments. Thank you -[greg](mailto:ecocommunity@protonmail.com "email Greg")
