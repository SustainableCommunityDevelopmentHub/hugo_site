# SCD Hub Organization


## Mission
To serve as a hub for sustainable community development (SCD) in order to provide trustworthy development & training tools to facilitate project planning, design & execution.
<BR><BR>

SCD Hub serves as a library of content (e.g. video, graphics, literature) related to water, wastewater management, and solidwaste  resources. Our aim in curating content is to clearly assess what approaches work and what approaches have challenges, and what kind? 
<BR><BR>


  
## VISION

  <BR>
To support community literacy in locally appropriate techniques and technologies that support climate, human, & ecosystem health.

[The SCD Hub Forum](http://mylunch.link:4567) now serves as a public interface for collecting and sharing current research before it is added to this website as a technology review page.
