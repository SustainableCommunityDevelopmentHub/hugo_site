Sustainable Community Development Hub is a registered 501c3 not for profit foundation in the USA and the state of Colorado.  Our work involves researching factors which contribte to successes and failures of sustainable community development practices.  We partner with organizations and individuals who are motivated to take action on climate, urban migration, desertification, ocean health, and deforestation by facilitating free SCD Hub Clinics.  Our online video library currently is focused of drinking and wastewater resource strategies, and we are adding to food security, renewable energy, zero waste, watershed planning, and human health subjects.

Our current efforts are to focus on the development of tinyfood tinyjunkyard .org sites, with free software <a href="https://github.com/tinyjunkyard/artkiosk_saleor">[1]</a> <a href="https://github.com/tinyfood/saleor-storefront">[2]</a> and free hosting [<a href="https://zeit.co">[1]</a> <a href="https://netlify.com">[2]</a>, free data storage <a href="https://github.com">[1]</a>,<a href="https://gitlab.com">[2]</a>,<a href="https://bitbucket.org">[3]</a> such that a low bar is established for groups working in these areas.
