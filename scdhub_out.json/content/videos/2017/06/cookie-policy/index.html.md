We at SCD Hub have worked to remove third party tracking tools from this website, as we are a Not for Profit organization in good standing in the state of Colorado, USA. 

We use our own private analytics package via [Piwik](https://piwik.org "Piwik web analytics"), and continue to work to improve the performance and security of the SCD Hub website and apps.
