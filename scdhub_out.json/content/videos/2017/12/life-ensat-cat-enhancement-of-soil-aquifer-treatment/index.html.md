The ENSAT Life+ project aims at enhancing and optimizing this technology, progressing from laboratory studies to a pilot field scale study (located at the recharge site of Sant Vicen√ß dels Horts, Barcelona). Results obtained and lessons learned will be able to be implemented to transfer sites in Europe to improve the operation of the trial and full scale Aquifer Recharge plants.
