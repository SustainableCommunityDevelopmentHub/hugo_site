The Duplex 55 pump jack water pressure system on the Hanson Farm of Cushing, WI., is leaking pressure.  This shows the well cap/head.  The jack runs a sucker rod up and down pumping water 90 feet below in a well cylinder.  Have to unbolt the head and see what kind of seals are in it.  Leaked some, then froze at the top and now leaks too much!

commment: There are still folks in rural areas who use pumpjacks, and so local well drillers and repair folks often have extra ones on hand.  I ended up replacing my well with a more modern pump and gave the old pumpjack to the well driller as he said he still fixed them and could use it for parts or replacement.  So contact your local rural well repairman and he will likely know about them.﻿ - RiverRoadRambler - 2 months ago
