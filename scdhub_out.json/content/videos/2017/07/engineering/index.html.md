# ENGINEERING EDUCATION

An estimated population growth of 1.5 billion people over the next two decades, 97% of it in developing regions, will exacerbate the already unprecedented demands for energy, food, land, water, transportation, materials, waste disposal, earth moving, public health care, environmental cleanup, telecommunication, and infrastructure [3]. The role of engineers will be critical in fulfilling these demands at various scales, ranging from small remote communities to large urban areas (megacities), mostly in the developing world.

Exploitative and degenerative cultures tend to have economic systems focused around the notions of scarcity and competitive advantage, whereas regenerative cultures understand how collaborative advantage can foster shared abundance.
