Our first SCD Hub clinic was conducted on July 25, 2017.

: outcomes

0- Greg and Heather discussed the basic setting, and vision that 
1- project initial assessment conducted and shared below
2- materials acquisition plan in place- shower base, electrical outlets, conduit, tarp for dry space once constructed, base on blocks in lieu of trailer, ( build base standard size for trailer later )
3- possible use of Greg's small trailer given to him by 'chainsaw john' it is legal but needs a drill hole and large bolt or welding to improve its roadworthyness.
4- Nederland's Eco pass considered in the context of Gold Hill for mass transit options... Ned's eco pass is free for people living in the library district. The Gold Hill 'Climb' is supposedly funded privately, and Gold Hill is part of unincorporated Boulder County, so we could try to tap into and expand the same fund to get Gold Hill residents free transit option like Ned residents have.

: a project-centric SCD Hub clinic...

The next meeting of this clinic is being planned to support Heather and Jim's vison of a tiny house.  Their project represents an exciting synergy combining hands on training, community networking, materials reuse awareness, waste stream diversion and what looks like an opportunity for good time in the mountains for all!

The Tiny House clinic held its initial meetup at Flatirons Coffee Tues July 26, 2017.  Please write in to tinyhouses@scdhub.org to get more info, or post a comment here. thank you!

 from discussion: Heather and Jim envision the mobile aspect of their future tiny house to be an asset should they take it up to Vancouver, BC or anywhere else in Canada.  Heather expressed concerns over whether any home insulation standards might effect them in the form of regulation when in Canada. Greg didn't think that there would be any 'hard requirements' for tiny house insulation standards to meet in place because tiny houses are mobile and generally not subject to the same building codes, but since you never know, it might be smart to consider meeting the 'superinsulated home' standards of r55 wall and ceiling insulations, and minimally the R19 standard we have here. Since Heather and Jim's tiny house is to be used in the mountains of Colorado, it doesn't hurt to go for the R55 standard.  Greg pointed out that he was able to get high quality insulating material from [Boulder Craigslist](https://boulder.craigslist.org/search/zip "Craigslist Boulder free stuff"), and that R55 wasn't an impossible standard to meet- that air to air heat exchangers can be employed as demonstrated in this video.
