Public health informatics is the application of computer science and information technology to public health practice, research and learning. This video uses the metaphor of building a house to show how informaticians build an information system working closely with programmers, network and data base administrators, security specialists, and Web designers. See an example of informatics at work in CDC's FluView Interactive, a series of dynamic pictures that allow any Internet user to access influenza (flu) information collected by CDC's monitoring systems.
