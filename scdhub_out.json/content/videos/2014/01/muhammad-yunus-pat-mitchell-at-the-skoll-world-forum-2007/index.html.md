Pat Mitchell sits down with Muhammad Yunus at the Skoll World Forum 2007. She talks about his life story and road to the Nobel Peace Prize, then asks him questions about social innovation. "Human beings are multi-dimensional," he says. "We should create a business to do good to people. Human beings not only want to be happy with the money they make, they want to be happy with the contributions they make."
