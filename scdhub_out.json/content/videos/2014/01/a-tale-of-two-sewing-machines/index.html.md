What happens when American and Australian women friends buy two manual sewing machines for Congolese women in a remote village? 

This short video documents the impact of a gift of two sewing machines to women in an isolated village in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 

Journey with the friends up the Congo River and its tributaries to see the results of their gift: From two manual sewing machines: income-generation; maternal health initiatives; nutrition garden; malaria prevention... and more.

A PowerPoint Presentation updates the story three years later: http://www.slideshare.net/betsyb123/h...
