The FOMINs Social Entrepreneurship Program (SEP) has helped more than 600,000 low-income people since its inception in 1998.

The SEP assists the poorest populations, with a focus on women, indigenous groups, and microentrepreneurs. In 2008, projects included microfinance for rural indigenous women's associations, credit for agricultural producers, and financing for solar energy for rural families off the energy grid.

New projects are focused on microenterprises in geotourism, small hydroelectric energy for rural families, among other initiatives.
