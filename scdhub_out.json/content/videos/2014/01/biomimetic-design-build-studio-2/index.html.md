This is an independent studio conducted under the direction of Kris Nelson and James Leach at Iowa State University. Four fifth-year architecture undergrads combined efforts to create a passively responsive prototype that was built at full scale to test the application of a biomimetic function. 

In the case of this studio the students were looking and the cellular level of plant leaves, where a stoma is an aperture used to control the movement of gases to and from the leaf. The thought was to enlarge this system and test it with a prototype. Through parametric modeling in Rhino and grasshopper a form was developed. Then in a form of design + build the prototype was constructed. 

The following people deserve thanks for helping to make this semester possible.Without their help this would have not been possible. Thank you.
