##Get Involved!

We are a new organization and we invite you to please engage us online in our social media, and at events, to share what kind of technologies you have been interested in, and we can do a clinic on that subject, to help connect the technology to ways it can be used at the practical, local scale.  When seeking appropriate technology solutions, simple, repairable, locally sourced and managed, locally understood all leads to a sense of ownership which is how success is measured.
