Some of our workshop locations are specifically located within or near natural areas.  We aim to make the features, needs, and opportunties of these natural areas an emphasis for our work.  We would like to support the development of a form of docent training for natural systems connecting native plants with 'pollinator islands' as described here.
 

More appreciation of nature through examimation of modern science and design's adoption of biomimicry.  New opportinties to work together in modern times while helping to reinforce ducationally the notion that good design has always been influenced by biomimetic principles.
