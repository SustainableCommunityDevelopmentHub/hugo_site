A combination of flooding from Irma and no power at almost all of the county&amp;rsquo;s 800 pump stations has caused sewage to back up into streets, homes and businesses instead of being pumped to sewage treatment plants.</description>

      <description>I recently spoke with the woman responsible for the years of successful operations at Ares Thrift Store in Boulder. I asked her what the concept of &amp;lsquo;Sustainable Community Development&amp;rsquo; meant to her; if she had anything to suggest anything for the SCD Hub video library. She explained that one of the biggest challenges was to vet the abilities of people who she had hired in the past for web design, graphic, print media design, various other tech duties.</description>

      <description>This project started out as a collection of videos contributed by students of Bernard Amadei&amp;rsquo;s graduate engineering class at CU Boulder, Colorado USA. The video and document content herein has been collected for its relevance in supporting the maintenance and decision making process common to sustainable community development projects.
We are now working to provide a service based on the video library which was created over a course of 7 years or so.</description>
