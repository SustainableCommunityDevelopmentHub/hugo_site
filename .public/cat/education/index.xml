This past summer the University of Missouri-Rolla&amp;rsquo;s chapter of Engineers Without Borders traveled to two destinations in Bolivia to apply their engineering skills to local problems. The first destination was a small boarding school in the Amazon. There the problem consisted of finding a clean source of water. The second location was in Inca Katurapi, a small village in the Andes where there had never been latrines. UMR students and faculty developed composting latrines for the community in an attempt to help reduce the infant mortality rate.</description>

What is an eco city? What will tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s green city look like? How do you build cities that do more with less to provide for ever-growing populations? Sustainable housing, energy efficiency, internmodal passenger transport, and smart grids for electrical distribution will all play a role in shaping the future of urban planning.
This animated short film gets to the heart of the challenges we face in making sustainable cities a reality.</description>
