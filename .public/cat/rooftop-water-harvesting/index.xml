      <description>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdg6Jwxb9bM Chris Russell Published on Dec 2, 2009   System demonstrated in the video shows how a small pond it used to store overflow, and how the rain bench diverter/ filter system works.  We just built a rain harvesting system using the do-it-yourself rain bench by Second Rain. We put it in our yard about 12 feet from the Saving Rain diverter that is in the downspout on the corner of our house.</description>

      <description>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsxuT-kgHPg Bill and Rosa Off Grid Published on Aug 11, 2015   In this video I cover the complete fresh water system for our cabin. We harvest rainwater for our needs. We use gutter system on the house to dump into five 55 gallon barrels then into a 250 gallon tote. We then transfer it into other storage when we can. Also we transfer it into our main 250 gallon tote to supply our home.</description>
