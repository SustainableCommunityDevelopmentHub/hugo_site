      <description>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-0KRJlnyO8 Early in the morning, risin&amp;rsquo; to the street Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong Got to find a reason why my money&amp;rsquo;s all gone I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got &amp;lsquo;Cause you might get run over or you might get shot Never start no static I just get it off my chest Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest Take a small example, take a tip from me Take all of your money, give it all to charity</description>
