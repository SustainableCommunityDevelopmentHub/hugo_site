      <description>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsxuT-kgHPg Bill and Rosa Off Grid Published on Aug 11, 2015   In this video I cover the complete fresh water system for our cabin. We harvest rainwater for our needs. We use gutter system on the house to dump into five 55 gallon barrels then into a 250 gallon tote. We then transfer it into other storage when we can. Also we transfer it into our main 250 gallon tote to supply our home.</description>

Rain Brothers LLC Published on May 22, 2015
We ( https://www.rainbrothers.com )specialize in rainwater harvesting systems used for drinking water. This is an overview of a residential project here in Ohio. The site had just been inspected by the Health Department, so we had all our trenches open and thought it would be a good opportunity to put together a video for reference.
It is important to note that we typically do not make hard connections to the tank (either with the pump supply line or the tank inlet and outlet) until the tank has been backfilled and compacted to the levels of the pipe connections.</description>
