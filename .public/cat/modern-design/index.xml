The Sakura Tiny House was recently completely by Minimaliste Homes in Qu√©bec. The house literally has not only everything you&amp;rsquo;d except in a traditional home, but it&amp;rsquo;s all done beautifully with some pretty darn impressive ways of going about it. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thanks Phil from Minimaliste for putting together this English version of The Sakura tiny house tour, thanks! See link below to their website.</description>
