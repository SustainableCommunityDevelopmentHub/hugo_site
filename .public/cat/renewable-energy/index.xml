The process continues building my Powerwall bigger and better Balancing the pack before installing it before I have a little issue with pixies escaping making some magic white smoke. I have to break off all the little plastic clips so it sits on the mount much better.</description>

Uploaded on Oct 25, 2007 This case study features interviews with Whistler&amp;rsquo;s municipal decision makers about the decision making process used to evaluate a new Natural Gas pipeline and the long-term energy needs of the community using the Natural Step Framework, and working with Terasen Gas to evaluate options. Community consultation, co-operation, and partnerships resulted in a successful process. The 2010 Olympics allowed the pipeline to be built at the same time as the road from Vancouver to Whistler.</description>
