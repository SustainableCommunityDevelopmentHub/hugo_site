Gary Pickering designs rolling pods for homeless people. Easy and relatively inexpensive to build, Gary&amp;rsquo;s pictures here show several of his pod prototypes. You can customize yours to your own liking. Build a rolling pod to be your very own &amp;ndash; for you and the things you own. You can do it!
