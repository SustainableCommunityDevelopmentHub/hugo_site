      <description>This project started out as a collection of videos contributed by students of Bernard Amadei&amp;rsquo;s graduate engineering class at CU Boulder, Colorado USA. The video and document content herein has been collected for its relevance in supporting the maintenance and decision making process common to sustainable community development projects.
We are now working to provide a service based on the video library which was created over a course of 7 years or so.</description>

This past summer the University of Missouri-Rolla&amp;rsquo;s chapter of Engineers Without Borders traveled to two destinations in Bolivia to apply their engineering skills to local problems. The first destination was a small boarding school in the Amazon. There the problem consisted of finding a clean source of water. The second location was in Inca Katurapi, a small village in the Andes where there had never been latrines. UMR students and faculty developed composting latrines for the community in an attempt to help reduce the infant mortality rate.</description>
