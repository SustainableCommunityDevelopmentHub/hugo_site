Written and produced by Melissa Mergner in 2006, when she was a 14-year-old high school student, Woody Guthrie &amp;ndash; Voice of the Common Man is a short documentary about how the folk singer-songwriter overcame personal hardship and tragedy to become a spokesman for those Americans affected by the Great Depression and the dust storms. Although neither a politician nor activist, Guthrie brought attention to the plight of Okies, migrant workers and other disenfranchised people.</description>
