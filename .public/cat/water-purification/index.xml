      <description>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsba3JetBrM Published on Apr 21, 2017 On the whole, American drinking water is safe. However, more than a year after toxic lead levels forced a federal state of emergency in Flint, MI, 63 percent of Americans report that they worry a great deal about polluted drinking water. This statistic comes from a new Gallup poll indicating that water pollution ranks the highest of six environmental concerns among respondents. While pipes in Flint are expected to be replaced with the help of a $97 million settlement, there are other cities with histories of unsafe lead levels - or other toxins - in drinking water.</description>

This past summer the University of Missouri-Rolla&amp;rsquo;s chapter of Engineers Without Borders traveled to two destinations in Bolivia to apply their engineering skills to local problems. The first destination was a small boarding school in the Amazon. There the problem consisted of finding a clean source of water. The second location was in Inca Katurapi, a small village in the Andes where there had never been latrines. UMR students and faculty developed composting latrines for the community in an attempt to help reduce the infant mortality rate.</description>

A documentary about Engineers Without Borders&amp;rsquo; work in Ngelenge, Tanzania.

Jason Shankel3 years ago Check out Engineers Without Borders. There are student and professional chapters all over the US. As for projects, need isn&amp;rsquo;t the only criterion. We seek out communities that are committed to local development. In this case, Ngelenge identified their needs and their preferred solutions and we provided expertise and some financial assistance. Helping people with their own ideas always works better than just providing them with aid.</description>
