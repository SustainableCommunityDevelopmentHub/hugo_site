Yeah this law is some pandering BS and addresses nothing. It won&amp;rsquo;t stop or even slow down gentrification. It will just be a waste of taxpayer money as it is struck down as a 1st amendment violation. Brokers suck. But they aren&amp;rsquo;t the problem. Landlords, stupid zoning laws, and mega tall buildings designed to be tax shelters are the problem.
