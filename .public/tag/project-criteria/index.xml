via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing
Satisficing is a decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic that entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met.[1] The term satisficing, a combination of satisfy and suffice,[2] was introduced by Herbert A. Simon in 1956,[3] although the concept was first posited in his 1947 book Administrative Behavior.[4][5] Simon used satisficing to explain the behavior of decision makers under circumstances in which an optimal solution cannot be determined.</description>
