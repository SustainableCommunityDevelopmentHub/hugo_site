tigercreekfarm Published on Sep 14, 2016 SUBSCRIBE 114 SUBSCRIBE SUBSCRIBED UNSUBSCRIBE Our last extened power outage prompted me to put down another well - one we could easily use both manually and electrically. This was dug by hand using a Seymour hole auger. I hit water at 14 feet - dug 5 feet further and put in my pipes. We have a water level of 5 feet in this well.</description>
