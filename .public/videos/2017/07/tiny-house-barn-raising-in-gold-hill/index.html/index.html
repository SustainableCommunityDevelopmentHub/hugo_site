<p>The next meeting of this clinic is being planned to support Heather and Jim&rsquo;s vison of a tiny house.  Their project represents an exciting synergy combining hands on training, community networking, materials reuse awareness, waste stream diversion and what looks like an opportunity for good time in the mountains for all!</p>

<p>The Tiny House clinic held its initial meetup at Flatirons Coffee Tues July 26, 2017.  Please write in to tinyhouses@scdhub.org to get more info, or post a comment here. thank you!</p>

<p>from discussion: Heather and Jim envision the mobile aspect of their future tiny house to be an asset should they take it up to Vancouver, BC or anywhere else in Canada.  Heather expressed concerns over whether any home insulation standards might effect them in the form of regulation when in Canada. Greg didn&rsquo;t think that there would be any &lsquo;hard requirements&rsquo; for tiny house insulation standards to meet in place because tiny houses are mobile and generally not subject to the same building codes, but since you never know, it might be smart to consider meeting the &lsquo;superinsulated home&rsquo; standards of r55 wall and ceiling insulations, and minimally the R19 standard we have here. Since Heather and Jim&rsquo;s tiny house is to be used in the mountains of Colorado, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to go for the R55 standard.  Greg pointed out that he was able to get high quality insulating material from <a href="https://boulder.craigslist.org/search/zip" title="Craigslist Boulder free stuff">Boulder Craigslist</a>, and that R55 wasn&rsquo;t an impossible standard to meet- that air to air heat exchangers can be employed as demonstrated in this video.</p>
