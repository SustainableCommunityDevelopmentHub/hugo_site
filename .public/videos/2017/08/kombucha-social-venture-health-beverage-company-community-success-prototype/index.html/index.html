Published on Aug 2, 2013</p>

<p>Kombucha is brewed in open-air vessels covered tightly with fine-weave cloth. Use culinary-grade ceramic, glass or stainless steel to ensure your &lsquo;buch will be the healthiest &lsquo;buch on your block. Here are some of our favorite vessels for fermenting &lsquo;buch.
This is the same jar that we supply in all of our 1-gallon Kombucha Home Brew Kits. Makes an excellent replacement, or if you want to expand your brewing capabilities, jump into a second or a third jar
Made in the USA specially for KBBK, guaranteed lead-free, and has a shorter, more discrete profile than our glass 1-gallon brew jars.
If you&rsquo;ve got smaller batches under control, and are tired of wrangling many smaller vessels, just give &lsquo;em away and jump to 10 gallons.
This will fill 8 of our 32-oz growlers. One easy-to-clean vessel, a step up to the next level - one love for the &lsquo;buch.
Discrete and heavy duty, this crock will last a lifetime, and your mother will love her roomy new home. Consider L&rsquo;Auto Siphon to make bottling a cinch!</p>
