Flow rate and operation of slow sand filter explained along with gradiation of fine sand and gravel below the source water.
Flow rates of 0.015-0.15 gpm/ ft^2 expected for typical performance with entry water of &amp;lt; 10 NTU..
Two day period of establishing Schmutzdecke Algal layer on the surface of the slow sand filter is explained and how that period sends water passing though back to the waste water well rather than stored in the clearwell.</description>

A quick look at roof water harvesting using a slow sand filter combined with a diverter. This is an overview of the procedure and a demonstration of a working system. An instructional video on how to build a system can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-_RDB&amp;hellip; As of September 18, 2016 this filter is still running and producing clean water.</description>
