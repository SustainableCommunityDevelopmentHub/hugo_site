via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing
Satisficing is a decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic that entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met.[1] The term satisficing, a combination of satisfy and suffice,[2] was introduced by Herbert A. Simon in 1956,[3] although the concept was first posited in his 1947 book Administrative Behavior.[4][5] Simon used satisficing to explain the behavior of decision makers under circumstances in which an optimal solution cannot be determined.</description>

Jason Shankel3 years ago Check out Engineers Without Borders. There are student and professional chapters all over the US. As for projects, need isn&amp;rsquo;t the only criterion. We seek out communities that are committed to local development. In this case, Ngelenge identified their needs and their preferred solutions and we provided expertise and some financial assistance. Helping people with their own ideas always works better than just providing them with aid.</description>

Practical Action has transformed the lives of communities living in remote Andean villages through the installation of micro-hydro plants providing electricity to over 30,000 people. Lack of access to electricity for these remote communities has restricted the economic development of the area with many people leaving in search of better opportunities. Since the arrival of micro-hydro the area is thriving as those who had left are returning, bringing their businesses with them, and others are also migrating to the area.</description>

Pump Aid&amp;rsquo;s Elephant Pump was developed and tested in Zimbabwe by Pump Aid and is based on a 2000 year old Chinese rope-and-washer design. It is cheap, simple and durable. It can be easily constructed from materials available locally and can be maintained by local communities. In this clip there is a 3-D animation of the pump, showing it&amp;rsquo;s inner workings during operation. For more information, visit http://www.pumpaid.org</description>

What is an eco city? What will tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s green city look like? How do you build cities that do more with less to provide for ever-growing populations? Sustainable housing, energy efficiency, internmodal passenger transport, and smart grids for electrical distribution will all play a role in shaping the future of urban planning.
This animated short film gets to the heart of the challenges we face in making sustainable cities a reality.</description>
