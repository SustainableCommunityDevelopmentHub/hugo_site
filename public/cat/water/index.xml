&amp;ldquo; Raw sewage has been bubbling up through manholes on streets all over Collier County - even covering a section of Mahogany Bend Drive in Fiddler&amp;rsquo;s Creek with thick waste.
A combination of flooding from Irma and no power at almost all of the county&amp;rsquo;s 800 pump stations has caused sewage to back up into streets, homes and businesses instead of being pumped to sewage treatment plants.</description>

      <description>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsba3JetBrM Published on Apr 21, 2017 On the whole, American drinking water is safe. However, more than a year after toxic lead levels forced a federal state of emergency in Flint, MI, 63 percent of Americans report that they worry a great deal about polluted drinking water. This statistic comes from a new Gallup poll indicating that water pollution ranks the highest of six environmental concerns among respondents. While pipes in Flint are expected to be replaced with the help of a $97 million settlement, there are other cities with histories of unsafe lead levels - or other toxins - in drinking water.</description>

Pump Aid&amp;rsquo;s Elephant Pump was developed and tested in Zimbabwe by Pump Aid and is based on a 2000 year old Chinese rope-and-washer design. It is cheap, simple and durable. It can be easily constructed from materials available locally and can be maintained by local communities. In this clip there is a 3-D animation of the pump, showing it&amp;rsquo;s inner workings during operation. For more information, visit http://www.pumpaid.org</description>
