This is a clip from the documentary film &amp;ldquo;Trinity And Beyond The Atomic Bomb Movie&amp;rdquo; narrated by William Shatner. I replaced the soundtrack with the song &amp;ldquo;Washintu&amp;rdquo; by Ethiopian singer Gigi. Her hypnotic sound blends well with the footage.
Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie is a 1995 American documentary film directed by Peter Kuran and narrated by William Shatner.</description>

      <description>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-0KRJlnyO8 Early in the morning, risin&amp;rsquo; to the street Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong Got to find a reason why my money&amp;rsquo;s all gone I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got &amp;lsquo;Cause you might get run over or you might get shot Never start no static I just get it off my chest Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest Take a small example, take a tip from me Take all of your money, give it all to charity</description>

song : Bringin&amp;rsquo; Home the Rain artist : The Builders and the Butchers album :The Builders and the Butchers
lyrics:
Blood-shot, your eyes drop, And the skin&amp;rsquo;s all wearin&amp;rsquo; thin. There&amp;rsquo;s no one here to tell you &amp;lsquo;bout the depth of the water, Or the trouble that you&amp;rsquo;re in.
You&amp;rsquo;re dancin&amp;rsquo; with your demons, baby, You forgot your former life. And it was hard swimmin&amp;rsquo; once And now you&amp;rsquo;re daily divin&amp;rsquo; in.</description>
