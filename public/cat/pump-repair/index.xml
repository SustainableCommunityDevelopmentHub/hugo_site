The Duplex 55 pump jack water pressure system on the Hanson Farm of Cushing, WI., is leaking pressure. This shows the well cap/head. The jack runs a sucker rod up and down pumping water 90 feet below in a well cylinder. Have to unbolt the head and see what kind of seals are in it. Leaked some, then froze at the top and now leaks too much!</description>
