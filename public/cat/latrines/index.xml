3 million people live on the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia. Latrinology Tech, a group of Mechanical and Chemical Engineers from the University of Queensland, have designed a Latrine in conjunction with EWB Australia to be introduced into the communities of the lake. With this product, we aim to improve water quality and standards of sanitation in the region.

This past summer the University of Missouri-Rolla&amp;rsquo;s chapter of Engineers Without Borders traveled to two destinations in Bolivia to apply their engineering skills to local problems. The first destination was a small boarding school in the Amazon. There the problem consisted of finding a clean source of water. The second location was in Inca Katurapi, a small village in the Andes where there had never been latrines. UMR students and faculty developed composting latrines for the community in an attempt to help reduce the infant mortality rate.</description>
