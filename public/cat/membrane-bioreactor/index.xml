Wastewater treatment plants are intended to be the main part of water reuse and recirculation into water network. There are different types of IWTP models in terms of hydraulic and process performance. Today, the application of MBR system in wastewater treatment process as an output filter for effluent is of primary importance. This model is a small scale form of an urban wastewater treatment plant using extended aeration and MBR system.</description>
