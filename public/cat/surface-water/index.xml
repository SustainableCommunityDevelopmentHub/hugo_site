Seqwater Published on Jul 13, 2016 SUBSCRIBE 410 SUBSCRIBE SUBSCRIBED UNSUBSCRIBE Our water can come from a range of sources.
Surface water is water from creeks and rivers, stored in dams and weirs. In South East Queensland, surface water is the most common source of drinking water.
No single water supply option can meet South East Queensland&amp;rsquo;s long-term water security needs. As a community, we need to consider our demand for water, the water supply options available to us and the way we operate the SEQ Water Grid.</description>
