Rain Brothers LLC Published on May 22, 2015
We ( https://www.rainbrothers.com )specialize in rainwater harvesting systems used for drinking water. This is an overview of a residential project here in Ohio. The site had just been inspected by the Health Department, so we had all our trenches open and thought it would be a good opportunity to put together a video for reference.
It is important to note that we typically do not make hard connections to the tank (either with the pump supply line or the tank inlet and outlet) until the tank has been backfilled and compacted to the levels of the pipe connections.</description>
