I AM KINDNESS- Mount Olivet Surprise Makeovers
Sarah Edwards Published on Apr 24, 2013 SUBSCRIBE 27 www.iamsarahedwards.com
I AM KINDNESS is group of volunteers that perform random acts of kindess throughout the city; sparking inspiration, promoting goodwill and spreading more smiles. This is was their first outing at Mount Olivet Senior Care Center. It was an amazing success.
