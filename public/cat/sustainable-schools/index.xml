Seaton Primary School in Devon lives out its school motto of &amp;lsquo;Caring now for the Future&amp;rsquo;, and is one of a few UK schools to install a range of renewable technologies. A 2.5 kW wind turbine and a 4.7 kW PV array on the roof of the school hall supply electricity directly to the school and have helped reduce CO2 emissions by about 2 tonnes a year.</description>
