Pump Aid&amp;rsquo;s Elephant Pump was developed and tested in Zimbabwe by Pump Aid and is based on a 2000 year old Chinese rope-and-washer design. It is cheap, simple and durable. It can be easily constructed from materials available locally and can be maintained by local communities. In this clip there is a 3-D animation of the pump, showing it&amp;rsquo;s inner workings during operation. For more information, visit http://www.pumpaid.org</description>
