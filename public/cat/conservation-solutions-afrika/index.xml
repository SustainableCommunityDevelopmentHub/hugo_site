Hukka Wario 4 months ago This book, The Big Conservation Lie, by Mbaria and Ogada is a must read for all who respect traditional and indigenous pastoralist peoples living in harmony with nature and with wildlife, and who have a reason to look with distrust and suspicion at the new white self proclaimed apostles of wildlife conservation, who have established rangeland trusts financed by western capital and displacing, peripheralizing and marginalizing pastoral peoples branding then invaders, bandits, poachers and even terrorists in their own ancestral lands.</description>
