Published on May 5, 2013 This is an independent studio conducted under the direction of Kris Nelson and James Leach at Iowa State University. Four fifth-year architecture undergrads combined efforts to create a passively responsive prototype that was built at full scale to test the application of a biomimetic function.
In the case of this studio the students were looking and the cellular level of plant leaves, where a stoma is an aperture used to control the movement of gases to and from the leaf.</description>
