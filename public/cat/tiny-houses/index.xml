A 20ft Shipping Container can be a challenging space to work with when constructing a home. Thankfully, with years of experience building super-yachts and racing boats, shipwright Evans is no stranger to working in small spaces and when it came to building his own home he has done a truly spectacular job of, quite literally, thinking inside the box.</description>

The Sakura Tiny House was recently completely by Minimaliste Homes in Qu√©bec. The house literally has not only everything you&amp;rsquo;d except in a traditional home, but it&amp;rsquo;s all done beautifully with some pretty darn impressive ways of going about it. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thanks Phil from Minimaliste for putting together this English version of The Sakura tiny house tour, thanks! See link below to their website.</description>
