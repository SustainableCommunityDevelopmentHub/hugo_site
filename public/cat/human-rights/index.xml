Written and produced by Melissa Mergner in 2006, when she was a 14-year-old high school student, Woody Guthrie &amp;ndash; Voice of the Common Man is a short documentary about how the folk singer-songwriter overcame personal hardship and tragedy to become a spokesman for those Americans affected by the Great Depression and the dust storms. Although neither a politician nor activist, Guthrie brought attention to the plight of Okies, migrant workers and other disenfranchised people.</description>

As a part of SCD Hub&amp;rsquo;s ongoing work collecting important &amp;lsquo;soft skills&amp;rsquo; videos and resources, we take a look at addiction as a human rights issue. Johann Hari&amp;rsquo;s important work helps us understand addiction as a symptom of social isolation. If as he states, &amp;ldquo;the opposite of addiction is not sobriety, the opposite of addiction is connection&amp;rdquo;, then sustainable community development is the only way to really address the modern crisis of opiate, alcohol and sugar addiction in modern society.</description>
