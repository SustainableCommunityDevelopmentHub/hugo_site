This is how my gravity fed spring water works at the Luck Cabin. It brings water down to outside the house, inside, and to my animals. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing and very simple. The spring water is super cold and tastes sweet pure.

A documentary about Engineers Without Borders&amp;rsquo; work in Ngelenge, Tanzania.

Jason Shankel3 years ago Check out Engineers Without Borders. There are student and professional chapters all over the US. As for projects, need isn&amp;rsquo;t the only criterion. We seek out communities that are committed to local development. In this case, Ngelenge identified their needs and their preferred solutions and we provided expertise and some financial assistance. Helping people with their own ideas always works better than just providing them with aid.</description>
