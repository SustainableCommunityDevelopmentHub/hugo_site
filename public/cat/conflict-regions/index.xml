      <description>Last summer, as part of the Colorado Shakespeare Festivals &amp;ldquo;Original Practices&amp;rdquo; there was a production of Henry VI Part 3.
Original Practice&amp;rsquo;s Production are plays done as Shakespeare would have done them. There is no artificial sound or lighting, no amplification, and with whatever costumes are on hand. Actors are given only their lines and cues, rather than complete scripts, and a mere 20 hours of rehearsal.
In November, 2016, Oxford University Press released its new edition of the complete works of William Shakespeare and credited Christopher &amp;lsquo;Kit&amp;rsquo; Marlowe as being a co-author on the three Henry VI plays based on scholarship and 21st-century computerized tools to analyse texts.</description>
