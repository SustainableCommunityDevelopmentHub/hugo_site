GLASCO ULTRAVIOLET Published on May 15, 2014
This video is about changing UV wastewater lamps in a horizontal configuration. The plant maintains 100 modules each with 6 lamps. The video is generic and meant to show engineers, owners and operators the maintenance involved. Entire lamp change would be 40 hours x 2 operators.
note that some systems come with self cleaning rings which are moved along the glass surface to keep optical transmission high.</description>
