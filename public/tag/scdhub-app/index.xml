We are in beta and only available on Android.
Look for the SCD Hub in the IOS app store by Aug 8 2017 or so. We seem to be currently in a two week &amp;lsquo;name validation&amp;rsquo; cycle. No bigdeal.
The hopes we have for the app is initially to have our curated library available for video viewing, and personal learning materials management.
Thank you for the support thus far. Greg</description>
