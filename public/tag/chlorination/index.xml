The free chlorine maintenance does not affect water quality, and the water remains safe for use. Consumers who are sensitive to taste and odor changes in drinking water might notice a slight change during this period, however this palatability change does not alter the quality of the drinking water. For more information, visit https://www.ntmwd.com
The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) has scheduled a free chlorine maintenance that will be conducted on its water transmission system and customer cities&amp;rsquo; distribution systems for a 28-day period from March 7-April 4.</description>
