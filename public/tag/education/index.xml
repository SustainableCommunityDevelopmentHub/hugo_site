SCD Hub&amp;rsquo;s support for both traditional and non-traditional learning is an outgrowth of the curation of our video library. The library is a product of Bernard Amadei&amp;rsquo;s graduate students contributions while in the Sustainability in the Built Environment class over a course of 8 years. While available as &amp;lsquo;approvideo.org&amp;rsquo; our library has since been used as part of the professional resources ACME makes available to its members.</description>
